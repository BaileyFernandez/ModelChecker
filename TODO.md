## Semantics

- [ ] print z3 constraints and declarations to `test_file` script
- [ ] bypass semantics, printing semantic constrains to a `test_file`
  - [ ] `frame_constraints`
  - [ ] `prop_constraints`
  - [ ] `extra_constraints`
  - [ ] `semantics`

## Examples

- [ ] `test_complete` cases
  - [ ] `\neg B, A \boxright B` does not entail `\neg B \boxright \neg A` 
    - works without `\neg B`.
    - [ ] _B_ step through `neg_unsat.md` building model
  - [ ] `\neg A, A \boxright C` does not entails `(A \wedge B) \boxright C`
    - works without `\neg A`.
  - [ ] `A \boxright C, B \boxright C` entails `(A \wedge B) \boxright C`
  - [ ] `(A \wedge B) \boxright C` entails `A \boxright (B \boxright C)`
    - it is working by finding models where A and B incompatible
    - adding `\neg ((A \wedge B) \boxright D)` avoids this
    - will this come out in the wash once model checker can step through multiple models?
  - [ ] `A \boxright (B \boxright C)` does not entail `(A \wedge B) \boxright C`
    - this does not find models for N = 3
    - very slow for N = 5 (ran for minutes on the remote server)
- [ ] _B_ provide countermodels by hand
  - [ ] `ent_2`
  - [ ] `poss_strength`
    - [ ] `A => C` is true though there is an `A`-alternative where `C` is false
    - [ ] replacing `verify` with `non_null_verify` eliminates models
      - [ ] _B_ check validity by hand

- [x] `world_bits` sometimes includes non-maximal worlds
  - M: do you have any examples (ie, file name and N value) for when this is true, to try to see what's going on?

  - M: if this is issue #13, I think this is now fixed!
- [x] _M_ avoid having to make `N` not equal to a multiple of 4
  - M: try manual route
  - B: I added an issue about this with some points from Graham
- [x] _B_ push conversion from bits to states late in print
- [x] _B_ integrate `alt_worlds`
- [x] _M_ functions in `print.py` can probably be improved (see notes there)
  - B: looks much better!
  - B: replacing `string_part` in `print.py` with `bit_part` seems to work, but my linter doesn't like it. not sure if that is any concern.
  - M: Cleaned up what I hadn't been able to get to before and left commentsâ€”feel free to delete any comments that are resolved/solved
  - M: linter issue unsolved, but I wasn't getting it on my end, maybe your linter is stricter than mine lol
- [x] _M_ allow for more than 26 atomic states in `bitvec_to_substates`
  - M: I have a soln, something that seemed intuitive to me (not subindices)
  - B: looks great!
- [x] _M_ remove quotes from output of `bitvec_to_substates` when printing

  - B: Looks perfect!
- [x] _M_ `Equivalent` function in Z3?
  - M: seems you can just use `==` (I'm pretty sure but not 100% sure). I left the `Equivalent` function we had and replaced its body to the new definition `==`; if you notice any changes or anything going wrong, we can always switch back to the old one. However, I am almost certain that if equivalence isn't represented by `==`, then there is no function for equivalence (cf: https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/logic/propositional-logic, and in the list of all funcs in Z3, could not find anything that looked like it'd reasonably be equivalence)
  - B: Awesome! It works great!

- [x] _M_ show that `A \boxright B, A \wedge B \boxright C` entails `A \boxright C` (in `ent_3.py`)
- [x] _B_ show `{ A \boxright (B \vee C), \neg(A \boxright B), \neg(A \boxright C) }` is sat
- [x] _B_ show `{ (A \vee B) \boxright C, \neg(A \boxright B) }` is unsat

  - [x] _B_ build concrete model

- [x] _B_ abstract on multiple occurrences of `all_bits`
- [x] _B_ separate model building, eval building, and printing elements (see NOTE in `print.py`)

- [x] _B_ assign either `world`, `possible`, or `impossible` to each printed state
  - [x] _M_ revise state labeling strategy I hacked together

- [x] _M_ name all atomic states in the model with lowercase letters `a, b, c, ...`
- [x] _M_ represent all states in the model as fusions, e.g., `a.b.c, d.e, a, ...`

## Planning

- [x] review and revise plan for the project
- [x] create scaffolding for documentation, TODOS, and project updates
- [x] identify tooling (noting this in the docs)
  - [x] what else in addition to python3 and Z3 is needed?
  - [x] is latex ok for the overview?
- [x] get git working

## Definitions

- [x] _M_ `extended_verify` see strategies
- [x] _M_ `extended_falsify` see strategies
    - M: at the end of `semantics.py` (both extended verify and falsify)
- [x] _M_ recursive definition of `true` see strategies
    - M: at the end of `semantics.py`
- [x] _B_ `proposition` see strategies
- [x] _B_ add docstrings to `definitions.py`
- [x] _B_ maximal
- [x] _B_ compatible
- [x] _B_ world

## Python

- [x] _M_ sentence letter extractor
- [x] _M_ prefix function
  - [x] _M_ review `/Design/Strategies.md`, raising any questions in the corresponding GitHub issue.
  - [x] _M_ confirm whether LaTeX commands will serve as suitable notation in python
  - [x] _M_ function translating into prefix notation
    - [x] _M_ clean up function names/stray parts
    - [x] _M_ check that `(A \\wedge B)` goes to `[Wedge, A, B]`
      - _M_: it doesn't, but I think the way it is now is better. To get rid of the backslashes would involve another function that may take a lot of computation, but we could leave it like this (right now it accepts double backslash, forwardslash, and no slashes) so that there is maximum flexibility on the user end. Internally of course the issue will have to be resolved, but I think it's easier to map 3 versions of the same command to one function or semantic requirement (ie, \\wedge /wedge and wedge all to Wedge) than to fix them all to a string of that semantic requirement.
      - _B_: sounds good.
