# Methodology Documentation Has Moved

The methodology documentation has been reorganized into a comprehensive directory structure.

The new structure includes:
- [Builder Pattern](methodology/BUILDER_PATTERN.md) - Pipeline orchestration
- [Syntax](methodology/SYNTAX.md) - AST conversion
- [Semantics](methodology/SEMANTICS.md) - Constraint generation
- [Models](methodology/MODELS.md) - SMT solving
