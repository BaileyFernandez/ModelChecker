## Verification Notes

### Common Issues Found
- **Incorrect file paths**: Several documentation files referenced non-existent paths (e.g., z3_utils.py, defaults.py, proposition.py, registry.py)
- **Missing theory-specific files**: References to logos/models.py, exclusion/models.py, etc. don't exist
- **Actual locations differ**: Classes like ModelDefaults, Z3ContextManager, LogosProposition were in different files than documented
- **Minor signature differences**: Some constructor parameter names differed (e.g., 'settings' vs 'combined_settings')

### Patterns to Check
1. **Import statements** - Verify module paths exist
2. **Class definitions** - Match actual class names and inheritance
3. **Method signatures** - Correct parameter names and defaults
4. **File paths** - All `[link](../../Code/...)` paths are valid
5. **Code examples** - Runnable and accurate
6. **Z3 API usage** - Correct function names and parameters
7. **Directory structures** - Match actual file organization

## Progress Summary
- Total files: 7
- Verified: 5 (ARCHITECTURE.md, BUILDER.md, ITERATOR.md, SYNTAX.md, README.md)
- Fixed: 2 (MODELS.md, SEMANTICS.md)
- In progress: 0
- Remaining: 0
