## Uninterpreted Sorts

(From: https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/advanced-examples.htm)

Function and constant symbols in pure first-order logic are uninterpreted or free, which means that no a priori interpretation is attached. This is in contrast to arithmetic operators such as + and - that have a fixed standard interpretation. Uninterpreted functions and constants are maximally flexible; they allow any interpretation that is consistent with the constraints over the function or constant.

To illustrate uninterpreted functions and constants let us introduce an (uninterpreted) sort A, and the constants x, y ranging over A. Finally let f be an uninterpreted function that takes one argument of sort A and results in a value of sort A. The example illustrates how one can force an interpretation where f applied twice to x results in x again, but f applied once to x is different from x.

    A    = DeclareSort('A')
    x, y = Consts('x y', A)
    f    = Function('f', A, A)

    s    = Solver()
    s.add(f(f(x)) == x, f(x) == y, x != y)

    print (s.check())
    m = s.model()
    print (m)
    print ("interpretation assigned to A:")
    print (m[A])

The resulting model introduces abstract values for the elements in A, because the sort A is uninterpreted. The interpretation for f in the model toggles between the two values for x and y, which are different. The expression m[A] returns the interpretation (universe) for the uninterpreted sort A in the model m.
