# Notes

- review counterfactual constraints when negated and not
- review design of `model_builder` and `print_model`
- existential quantifiers in `Semantics.py`
- define `alt_bits` in `print.py`
- CFs in `Semantics(w,X)`

TODOs

- ssh to supercomputer
- ask graham about
  - existential quantifier claims
  - powers of 2
  - M: I did some more digging around and it looks like there's no way around this, even within Z3 languages so to speak. There is a way to make all bitvecs in decimal format, but that's not something useful for us. My best source so far: https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/theories/Bitvectors/ (and other websites that say the same thing). This also makes sense given how .sexpr() works: it takes in the Z3 object in C and its location (https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/classz3py_1_1_ast_ref.html#ab41c56f8b1c61ace1b28a163103d86b4), making me think that the hexadecimal format for multiples of 4 (I thought it was powers of 2, but it's actually mults of 4) gets pretty down to low-level representation, meaning it's not like a more surface level thing we can flip. (copied and pasted this to relevant part in Questions.md)
  - trace
  - `is_bitvector` in `print.py` for `N > 4` (see TODO in `print.py`)
- multiprocessing
- organize semantics
- push conversion from bits to states late in print
- integrate `alt_worlds`
