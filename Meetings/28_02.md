# Notes

- [ ] `parts.py` looks good!
  - [ ] Q: How do BitVecs and BitVecVals differ?
  - [ ] Q: Is it still important to have bivectors with length not equal to a power of 2?
- [ ] the sentence extractor for `prefix_infix.py` looks good!
- [ ] `prop.py`
  - [ ] AtomSort vs sentence letters?
- [ ] `states.py`
  - [ ] Q: which definitions to include?
    - [ ] add: compatible, world, alternative?
    - [ ] add everything definable without reference to sentences?
  - [ ] Q: is the primitive `possible` a new sort?
- [ ] `semantics.py`
  - [ ] review documentation cut inot `sort.py`
  - [ ] Q: make sentence letters constants of AtomSort?
- [ ] `test_model.py`
  - [ ] see if we can get the model constraints working for two sentence letters
  - [ ] see if we can add semantic constraints for an explicitly given complex sentence 
  - [ ] abstract a model constraint generator from the concrete model constraints
  - [ ] abstract a semantic constraint generator from the concrete semantics constraints
