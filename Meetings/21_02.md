## Question

- [x] is the backslash notation going to be a problem?
- [ ] _M_ (from `Questions.md`)
  - [:] seems that BitVecVal is a more useful type than BitVec.
    - [.] it seems we'll need to initialize BitVec(Val)s as numbers
    - [x] this adds another interesting meta-layer to the project, bc the states are effectively numbers
    - [x] but we don't care about the facts they're numbers
  - [ ] there seems to also be a difference betewen #b (prefix for binary bitvectors) and bvor types (prefix for or-constructions, put loosely).
  - [ ] i haven't been able to find where this is formalized in the documentation of Z3.
  - [x] also, you can only do | (or) on bitvectors of the same number of bits.
- [.] _M_ How transparent do we want the model to be?
  - [x] we can easily just make states bitvectors
  - [.] it'd be nice to actually vizualize states as bitvectors instead of seeing them as numbers (or the ugly format that Z3 .sexpr() gives)
  - [ ] what is \lor? same as \vee?

## TODOs

- [x] update `Questions.md`
- [ ] _B_ integrate TODOS
