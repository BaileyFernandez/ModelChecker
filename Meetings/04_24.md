# NOTES

- comparison worlds 
  - NOTE: to find alt_worlds we need a comparison world which is not
  - provided here. instead of including a comparison world, I think it
  - might make sense to use a function instead.
  - M: That makes sense. I think we will need to talk about that on Wednesday.
  - I think I have a workaround to that, lmk if something like this is what you have in mind.
