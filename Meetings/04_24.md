# NOTES

- comparison worlds 
  - NOTE: to find alt_worlds we need a comparison world which is not
  - provided here. instead of including a comparison world, I think it
  - might make sense to use a function instead.
  - M: That makes sense. I think we will need to talk about that on Wednesday.
  - I think I have a workaround to that, lmk if something like this is what you have in mind.

- M: thought of a way that in principle should work to get N in test_complete, but it is going to be kind of messy and I think we might as well refactor semantics, definitions, and model_definitions before spending time implementing this (I can explain the idea in meeting, it's basically already implemented in the N_in_test_complete branch except for the resulting bugs, which is what takes so long to do about this)
