## Overview

This document provides a **comprehensive development process** for implementing new ModelChecker features following test-driven development (TDD) protocols and systematic design principles. The process ensures thorough research, careful planning, and high-quality implementation while maintaining full integration with existing codebase standards.

**Process Philosophy**: Following the design principles outlined in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), this implementation process emphasizes architectural clarity, test-driven development, and systematic refactoring to ensure maintainable, high-quality code.

**Key Standards Integration**:
- **[Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md)** - Coding and documentation standards
- **[Tests Guide](TESTS.md)** - Comprehensive testing procedures  
- **[Maintenance Documentation](../../Docs/maintenance/README.md)** - Complete project standards

## Quick Start for Existing Plans

If you already have an **approved implementation plan**, you can jump directly to the implementation phase:

### Prerequisites for Direct Implementation
1. **Approved implementation plan** with detailed phases
2. **Feature branch created** and properly named
3. **Tests designed** for each implementation phase
4. **Dependencies identified** and documented

### Jump to Implementation
```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# Verify implementation plan exists
ls docs/implementation-plans/your-feature-plan.md

# Start implementation process
# Jump to: Implementation Phase (Section 6)
```

**Note**: Even with existing plans, consider reviewing the Research Phase (Section 4) to ensure your understanding of the codebase is current before beginning implementation.

## Branch Management

### Branch Creation and Naming

Following version control standards from [Maintenance Documentation](../../Docs/maintenance/VERSION_CONTROL.md):

```bash
# Create feature branch with descriptive naming
git checkout -b feature/output-system-implementation
git checkout -b feature/theory-validation-enhancement  
git checkout -b fix/jupyter-display-ansi-handling

# Push branch and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Features**: `feature/descriptive-feature-name`
- **Bug Fixes**: `fix/specific-issue-description`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/component-or-system-name`
- **Documentation**: `docs/documentation-area-update`

### Branch Lifecycle Management
```bash
# Keep branch up to date with main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Regular commits during development
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase 1: Implement core infrastructure

- Add OutputManager class with basic interface
- Implement ColorManager with terminal detection
- Add comprehensive unit tests for color management
- Update configuration to support new settings

## Research Phase

### Codebase Analysis Methodology

Before designing any implementation, conduct systematic research to understand the current architecture and identify optimal integration points.

#### 1. Identify Relevant Components
```bash
# Search for related functionality
grep -r "relevant_keyword" src/
find . -name "*.py" -path "*/related_component/*"

# Examine directory structures
tree src/model_checker/related_area/
```

#### 2. Study Existing Patterns
- **Read component READMEs** to understand architecture
- **Examine similar implementations** in the codebase
- **Identify integration points** and dependencies
- **Document current limitations** and pain points

#### 3. Document Research Findings
Create `docs/research/your-feature-research.md`:

```markdown
# Feature Research: [Your Feature Name]

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing functionality**: What currently exists
- **Integration points**: Where new feature connects
- **Dependencies**: Required components and their interfaces
- **Limitations**: Current pain points and architectural issues

## Alternative Approaches
1. **Approach A**: Minimal integration approach
   - Pros: Low risk, quick implementation
   - Cons: Limited functionality, potential technical debt
   
2. **Approach B**: Comprehensive rewrite approach  
   - Pros: Clean architecture, full feature set
   - Cons: High risk, extensive testing required
   
3. **Approach C**: Hybrid approach (Recommended)
   - Pros: Balanced risk/reward, incremental improvement
   - Cons: Requires careful phase planning
```

#### 4. Present Research to User
- **Summary of current state** and identified issues
- **Multiple alternative approaches** with pros/cons analysis
- **Recommended approach** with detailed reasoning
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies

## Design Phase

### Implementation Plan Creation

Once the user has selected an approach, create a detailed implementation plan following TDD principles.

#### 1. Create Implementation Plan Document
Create `docs/implementation-plans/your-feature-plan.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Your Feature Name]

## Selected Approach
[Brief description of chosen approach and rationale]

## Test-Driven Development Strategy
- **Test categories**: Unit, integration, end-to-end
- **Testing framework**: Following [Tests Guide](../TESTS.md)
- **Success criteria**: Measurable outcomes for each phase

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Priority: High)
**Objective**: Establish basic framework and interfaces

**Tests to Write First**:
- `test_core_interface.py`: Test main API contracts
- `test_basic_functionality.py`: Test core feature behavior

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Create core classes and interfaces
2. Implement basic functionality
3. Add configuration support
4. Write comprehensive unit tests

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Core interface follows project standards
- [ ] Basic functionality works in isolation

### Phase 2: Integration (Priority: High)  
**Objective**: Integrate with existing codebase

**Tests to Write First**:
- `test_integration.py`: Test integration with existing components
- `test_backward_compatibility.py`: Ensure existing functionality preserved

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Update existing components to use new feature
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Add integration tests
4. Update configuration systems

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No existing functionality broken
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
```

#### 2. User Confirmation Process
Present the detailed implementation plan to the user for approval:
- **Phase breakdown** with clear objectives
- **Test-driven approach** for each phase
- **Success criteria** and validation methods
- **Risk mitigation** strategies for each phase

## Implementation Phase

### Phase-by-Phase Development

Following test-driven development protocols outlined in [Tests Guide](TESTS.md):

#### Phase Implementation Workflow

```bash
# For each phase:

# 1. Write tests first (Red phase)
# Create tests that define desired behavior
touch src/model_checker/feature/tests/test_phase_1.py

# Write failing tests that specify expected behavior
# Tests should be comprehensive and cover edge cases

# 2. Implement minimal code to pass tests (Green phase)  
# Create the simplest implementation that makes tests pass
touch src/model_checker/feature/core.py

# 3. Run tests to confirm implementation
./run_tests.py feature --verbose

# 4. Refactor for quality (Refactor phase)
# Improve code quality while maintaining test passing
# Follow Style Guide standards for code organization

# 5. Final validation
./run_tests.py --all  # Ensure no regressions
```

#### Phase Completion Protocol

After each phase:

1. **Validate Phase Success**:
   ```bash
   # Run phase-specific tests
   ./run_tests.py phase_1 --verbose
   
   # Run integration tests
   ./run_tests.py --integration
   
   # Check code quality
   grep -n '[^[:print:][:space:]]' src/  # Character validation
   ```

2. **Update Implementation Plan**:
   - Mark completed tasks as ‚úÖ 
   - Document any deviations from original plan
   - Note lessons learned or architectural discoveries
   - Update timeline estimates for remaining phases

3. **Commit Phase Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Phase 1 Complete: Core infrastructure implementation
   
   - Implemented OutputManager with unified interface
   - Added ColorManager with terminal detection  
   - Created comprehensive unit test suite (98% coverage)
   - Updated configuration system to support new settings
   - All tests passing, no performance regressions detected
   
   Next: Phase 2 - Integration with BuildModule

   ```

4. **Inform User of Progress**:
   - **Phase completion summary** with key achievements
   - **Test results** and coverage metrics
   - **Any issues encountered** and how they were resolved  
   - **Readiness for next phase** confirmation

#### Continuous Integration During Implementation

```bash
# Before each phase
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # Keep current with main branch

# During each phase  
./run_tests.py --unit     # Run unit tests frequently
./run_tests.py --examples # Validate examples still work

# After each phase
./run_tests.py --all      # Full test suite
git push origin feature/your-feature-name  # Keep remote updated
```

## Refinement Phase

### Post-Implementation Review

Once all planned phases are completed, conduct a comprehensive review to identify potential improvements.

#### 1. Implementation Review Process

**Code Quality Assessment**:
```bash
# Review code organization
find src/ -name "*.py" -path "*your_feature*" -exec wc -l {} +

# Check for code duplication
# Review similar patterns across the codebase

# Validate error handling
grep -r "raise\|except" src/your_feature/

# Performance analysis
# Run benchmarks if applicable
```

**Architecture Review**:
- **Design pattern consistency** with existing codebase
- **Interface cleanliness** and API usability
- **Extension points** for future enhancements
- **Integration quality** with existing components

#### 2. Identify Refinement Opportunities
