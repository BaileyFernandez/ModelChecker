# Iterator Display Improvements - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Status**: Completed  
**Affected Theories**: Exclusion, Imposition

## Summary

Fixed iterator display issues in exclusion and imposition theories where model differences were not being shown correctly during iteration, and removed unwanted ANSI escape sequences from output.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ANSI Escape Sequence Spillover
- **Problem**: Raw escape sequences `[1m[0m]` appearing in output
- **Cause**: `builder/module.py` printing empty ANSI sequences
- **Fix**: Removed unnecessary `print("\033[1m\033[0m", end="")` calls at lines 912 and 996

### 2. Incomplete Model Differences Display

#### Exclusion Theory
- **Problem**: Only showing "Structural Properties: Worlds: 1"
- **Cause**: Missing `print_model_differences` implementation in `WitnessStructure`
- **Fix**: Added complete implementation handling `world_changes` and `possible_changes` from generic calculator

#### Imposition Theory  
- **Problem**: Method existed but wasn't being called
- **Cause**: Method defined outside class, causing Python MRO to skip it
- **Fix**: Moved `print_model_differences` inside `ImpositionModelStructure` class

## Technical Details

### Key Mismatch Issue
The generic `DifferenceCalculator` provides keys:
- `world_changes` 
- `possible_changes`

But theory implementations were expecting:
- `worlds`
- `verifications`

Fixed by updating display methods to use the correct keys from the generic calculator.

### Files Modified

1. **src/model_checker/builder/module.py**
   - Removed ANSI escape sequence printing (lines 912, 996)

2. **src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/semantic.py**
   - Added `print_model_differences` method to `WitnessStructure` class
   - Handles world and possible state changes with color formatting

3. **src/model_checker/theory_lib/imposition/semantic.py**
   - Moved `print_model_differences` method inside `ImpositionModelStructure` class
   - Fixed method resolution order issue

## Testing

- ✅ Exclusion theory examples: All 38 examples pass
- ✅ Imposition theory examples: All 41 examples pass  
- ✅ No ANSI escape sequences in output
- ✅ Model differences display correctly with color coding

## Example Output

After fix, exclusion theory correctly shows:
```
=== DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS MODEL ===

World Changes:
  + c (now a world)
  - b (no longer a world)
  - a.c (no longer a world)

Possible State Changes:
  - b (now impossible)
  - a.c (now impossible)
  - a (now impossible)
```
