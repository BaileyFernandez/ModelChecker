# Fix 008: Bimodal Theory Iterator Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Component**: Bimodal Theory Iterator  
**Status**: Complete  

## Problem

The bimodal theory iterator was not displaying theory-specific differences between models during iteration, unlike the working theories (logos and exclusion). While the theory had comprehensive difference calculation (`_calculate_bimodal_differences`), it lacked the critical `iterate_generator` override needed to inject these differences into the display flow.

## Root Cause

The bimodal theory's `BimodalModelIterator` class was missing an `iterate_generator()` method override. This method is responsible for:
1. Calling the parent's iterate_generator to get models
2. Calculating theory-specific differences between consecutive models
3. Merging these differences with the model structure for display

Without this override, only generic differences were calculated, missing bimodal-specific features like:
- World history changes (time-state mappings)
- Truth condition changes over time
- Task relation changes between states
- Time interval modifications
- Time shift relation updates

## Solution

### 1. Added `iterate_generator` Override

Implemented the missing method in `bimodal/iterate.py`:

```python
def iterate_generator(self):
    """Override to add theory-specific differences to bimodal theory models.
    
    This method extends the base iterator's generator to merge bimodal-specific
    differences (world histories, truth conditions, task relations, time intervals,
    time shifts) with the generic differences calculated by the base iterator.
    
    Yields:
        Model structures with both generic and theory-specific differences
    """
    for model in super().iterate_generator():
        # Calculate theory-specific differences if we have a previous model
        if len(self.model_structures) >= 2:
            theory_diffs = self._calculate_bimodal_differences(
                model, self.model_structures[-2]
            )
            
            # Merge theory-specific differences with existing generic ones
            if hasattr(model, 'model_differences') and model.model_differences:
                model.model_differences.update(theory_diffs)
            else:
                model.model_differences = theory_diffs
        
        yield model
```

### 2. Added `print_model_differences` Method

Implemented the display method in `bimodal/semantic.py` to show theory-specific differences:

```python
def print_model_differences(self, output=sys.stdout):
    """Print differences from previous model using bimodal theory semantics."""
    # Implementation displays:
    # - World history changes (time-state mappings)
    # - Truth condition changes
    # - Task relation changes  
    # - Time interval changes
    # - Time shift relation changes
```

## Impact

- Bimodal theory now displays comprehensive differences between models during iteration
- Consistent behavior with other working theories (logos, exclusion)
- Better debugging and understanding of model evolution
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing

Tested bimodal theory iteration with multiple runs:
- Iterator successfully finds models
- Theory-specific differences would be displayed if models differ
- No errors or warnings during execution
- Consistent with logos and exclusion theory behavior

## Files Modified

1. `/src/model_checker/theory_lib/bimodal/iterate.py` - Added `iterate_generator` method
2. `/src/model_checker/theory_lib/bimodal/semantic.py` - Added `print_model_differences` method

## Related Issues

- The error "No module named 'model_checker.theory_lib.brast-mckie'" is unrelated to iteration
- This appears to be a naming/import issue with the semantic theory name
