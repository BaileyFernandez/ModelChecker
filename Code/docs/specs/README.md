# Development Specifications and Analysis

[← Back to Technical Docs](../README.md)

## Overview

This directory contains development artifacts including implementation plans, debugging analyses, and lessons learned from feature development. These documents track the evolution of the ModelChecker framework and preserve important insights gained during development.

## Directory Structure

### plans/
Numbered implementation plans for features and enhancements. Each plan follows test-driven development methodology and includes:
- Requirements and user flow
- Implementation phases with clear tasks
- Test specifications for each phase
- Success criteria

### debug/
Numbered debugging analyses documenting investigations into issues, including:
- Problem descriptions and symptoms
- Root cause analysis
- Test cases that reproduce issues
- Solution approaches evaluated

### findings/
Numbered reports of lessons learned and final outcomes, including:
- What worked well
- Challenges encountered
- Architectural insights
- Recommendations for future work

## Document Numbering

Documents are numbered sequentially within each category:
- `001_feature_name.md`
- `002_another_feature.md`
- etc.

## Major Accomplishments

### Save Output Feature (001-002)
**Completed**: August 2024
- Implemented structured output with EXAMPLES.md and MODELS.json
- Added ANSI to markdown color conversion
- Created modular output system with batch/sequential modes
- **Key Learning**: Separation of display and storage concerns enables clean architecture

### Interactive Save Feature (003)
**In Progress**: August 2024
- Adding interactive prompts for save decisions
- Per-example directory structure in interactive mode
- Path display with cd command suggestions

### V1 Release Preparation (002_v1_release_preparation)
**Created**: January 2025
- Comprehensive plan for bringing codebase to production-ready v1.0 status
- 5 implementation phases: Code Uniformity, API Consistency, Documentation, Testing, Release Prep
- Addresses module docstrings, type hints, TODO cleanup, and documentation completeness
- Timeline: 11-16 days estimated for full implementation

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Creating New Documents**: Use next sequential number with descriptive name
2. **Updating This README**: Add entry under Major Accomplishments when feature is complete
3. **Cross-References**: Link between related documents using relative paths
4. **Important Findings**: Incorporate into main documentation, code comments, or tests
