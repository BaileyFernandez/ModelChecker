# Development Specifications and Analysis

[← Back to Technical Docs](../README.md)

## Overview

This directory contains development artifacts including implementation plans, debugging analyses, and lessons learned from feature development. These documents track the evolution of the ModelChecker framework and preserve important insights gained during development.

## Directory Structure

### plans/
Implementation plans for features and enhancements. Each plan follows test-driven development methodology and includes:
- Requirements and user flow
- Implementation phases with clear tasks
- Test specifications for each phase
- Success criteria

### debug/
Debugging analyses documenting investigations into issues, including:
- Problem descriptions and symptoms
- Root cause analysis
- Test cases that reproduce issues
- Solution approaches evaluated

### findings/
Reports of lessons learned and final outcomes, including:
- What worked well
- Challenges encountered
- Architectural insights
- Recommendations for future work

### implementation/
Implementation summaries capturing key architectural decisions and code changes from completed features.

### research/
Research reports exploring different approaches to solving complex problems, comparative analyses, and recommendations.

### baselines/
Captured test outputs and regression baselines organized by development phase.

## Document Numbering Convention

Each directory maintains its own chronological numbering starting from 001, with numbers increasing by creation date. This allows tracking the progression of work within each category while seeing the most recent documents by their higher numbers.

Example:
- `debug/001_output_analysis.md` - First debug analysis
- `debug/006_iterator_constraint_analysis.md` - Most recent debug work
- `plans/001_output.md` - First implementation plan
- `plans/016_builder_theory_agnostic_refactor.md` - Most recent plan

## Major Development Timeline

### Output System Development
**Debug**: 001_output_analysis → 002_ctrl_c_save_output → 003_capture_analysis → 004_batch_output_format
**Plans**: 001_output → 002_structured_output → 003_interactive_save
**Findings**: 001_output_lessons
- Implemented structured output with EXAMPLES.md and MODELS.json
- Added ANSI to markdown color conversion
- Created modular output system with batch/sequential modes
- **Key Learning**: Separation of display and storage concerns enables clean architecture

### Model Refactoring
**Debug**: 005_test_failures_analysis → 006_iterator_constraint_analysis
**Plans**: 004_refactor_model_subpackage → 005_batch_output_enhancement → 006_input_provider_refactor
**Findings**: 003_model_refactoring_success → 007_model_py_removal_success
- Refactored monolithic model.py into organized subpackage structure
- Fixed iterator constraint preservation issues
- **Key Learning**: Breaking compatibility for cleaner architecture yields long-term benefits

### V1 Release Preparation
**Plans**: 007_remove_migrate → 008_v1_release_preparation_OLD → 009_v1_release_preparation
**Latest Plans**: 010_fresh_modelconstraints_implementation → 016_builder_theory_agnostic_refactor
- Comprehensive plan for bringing codebase to production-ready v1.0 status
- Includes continuous CLI testing and atomic commits
- **Current Status**: Addressing iterator constraint preservation issue

### Iterator Fix Investigation
**Findings**: 002_iterator_warnings_investigation → 015_iterator_fix_implemented
**Research**: 002_countermodel_iteration_approaches → 009_iterator_analysis_summary
- Deep investigation into MODEL 2+ constraint preservation
- Explored three approaches: constraint projection, evaluation override, solver integration
- **Key Finding**: Evaluation override approach successfully implemented

## Current Focus

The most recent work centers on the iterator constraint preservation issue:
- **Research**: 009_iterator_analysis_summary (most recent research)
- **Plans**: 016_builder_theory_agnostic_refactor (most recent plan)
- **Findings**: 015_iterator_fix_implemented (most recent finding)

The evaluation override approach (research/004) has been selected and implemented.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Creating New Documents**: Use next sequential number in the appropriate directory
2. **Updating This README**: Add entry under appropriate section when feature is complete
3. **Cross-References**: Link between related documents using relative paths
4. **Important Findings**: Incorporate into main documentation, code comments, or tests
