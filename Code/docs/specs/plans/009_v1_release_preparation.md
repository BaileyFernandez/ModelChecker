# V1 Release Preparation Plan

**Plan ID**: 009  
**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-09  
**Status**: Active - Phase 3 In Progress, Utils/Syntactic Migration Pending
**Author**: AI Assistant

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive preparation for ModelChecker v1.0, emphasizing incremental refactoring with rigorous testing at each step. Following the iterator regression incident (see [findings/002_iterator_warnings_investigation.md](../findings/002_iterator_warnings_investigation.md)), this plan incorporates continuous validation using dev_cli.py and comprehensive test suites.

**Key Achievements (2025-08-09)**:
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: model.py successfully split into models/ subpackage (93% reduction)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: utils.py successfully migrated to modular utils/ package
- ✅ **Iterator Fixed**: Structural variables iterator implemented with all theories producing MODEL 2
- ✅ **Utils Migration Complete**: Removed utils.py, renamed utils_new to utils
- 🟡 **Syntactic.py**: Recommend keeping as-is for v1.0 (stable, low risk)

**Key Changes from Original Plan**:
- Integrated continuous CLI testing with dev_cli.py throughout each phase
- Added targeted testing requirements for each refactoring step
- Incorporated baseline capture and regression detection protocols
- Extended timeline to accommodate thorough testing
- Successfully completed utils migration ahead of syntactic refactoring

## Problem Statement

The ModelChecker codebase requires significant refactoring before v1.0 release:
- Three monolithic modules exceed 800 lines each (model.py, utils.py, syntactic.py)
- Missing module docstrings and incomplete API documentation
- Inconsistent code organization and naming conventions
- Need for comprehensive test coverage verification

## Proposed Solution

### Core Architectural Principles

1. **Theory Agnostic Principle**: All framework components (builder, models, output, settings, iterate, etc.) must be completely theory-agnostic. They should not contain hardcoded references to specific theories or theory names. Theory-specific behavior must be encapsulated within the theory modules themselves.

2. **NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY**: Following CLAUDE.md principles, break compatibility freely for cleaner architecture. Never add compatibility layers or optional parameters for legacy support.

### Refactoring Strategy

1. **Incremental Refactoring**: Break monolithic modules into logical subpackages
2. **Continuous Testing**: Use dev_cli.py to validate behavior after each change
3. **Baseline Comparison**: Capture outputs before changes for regression detection
4. **Atomic Commits**: One logical change per commit with immediate testing
5. **Theory Independence**: Remove all theory-specific logic from framework components

### Testing Protocol

Each refactoring step MUST use BOTH testing methods to ensure comprehensive validation:

#### Method 1: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Test Runner

1. **Write Tests First** (following TESTS.md):
   ```bash
   # Create test file BEFORE moving code
   src/model_checker/models/tests/test_component.py
   
   # Run tests to ensure they fail appropriately
   ./run_tests.py --package --components models -v
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**:
   - Move/refactor code to pass tests
   - Ensure all tests pass

3. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   # Component tests
   ./run_tests.py --package --components models
   
   # Full regression
   ./run_tests.py --unit --package
   ```

#### Method 2: Direct CLI Testing with dev_cli.py (MANDATORY)

**Critical Requirement**: ALL examples.py files in theories and subtheories MUST be tested with dev_cli.py, especially those configured with iterate=2. This explicit testing ensures no regression occurs in real-world usage scenarios.

1. **Baseline Capture** (before any changes):
   ```bash
   # Test ALL theories and subtheories with their configured iterate settings
   # Main theories
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/examples.py > baseline/logos_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/examples.py > baseline/exclusion_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/imposition/examples.py > baseline/imposition_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/bimodal/examples.py > baseline/bimodal_before.txt 2>&1
   
   # ALL subtheories (each has one example with iterate=2)
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/counterfactual/examples.py > baseline/counterfactual_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/constitutive/examples.py > baseline/constitutive_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/extensional/examples.py > baseline/extensional_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/modal/examples.py > baseline/modal_before.txt 2>&1
   ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/relevance/examples.py > baseline/relevance_before.txt 2>&1
   ```

2. **After Each Change**:
   ```bash
   # Re-run ALL commands
   for theory in logos exclusion imposition bimodal; do
     ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/$theory/examples.py > current/${theory}_after.txt 2>&1
   done
   
   for subtheory in counterfactual constitutive extensional modal relevance; do
     ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/$subtheory/examples.py > current/${subtheory}_after.txt 2>&1
   done
   
   # Compare outputs
   for file in current/*_after.txt; do
     base=$(basename $file _after.txt)
     diff -u baseline/${base}_before.txt $file || echo "REGRESSION in $base"
   done
   
   # Check for ANY warnings/errors
   grep -E "WARNING|Error|FAILED|AttributeError|Symbolic expressions" current/*.txt
   ```

3. **Regression Criteria**:
   - NO new warnings or errors
   - Same model outputs
   - Same number of models found (especially with iterate=2)
   - No performance degradation
   - NO "Symbolic expressions cannot be cast to concrete Boolean values" errors

### Debugging Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Use errors as opportunities to improve codebase quality through deep analysis and systematic improvements.

1. **Fail-Fast Strategy**:
   - Prefer deterministic failures with helpful error messages
   - Avoid silent failures that hide problems
   - Catch errors early in the development cycle
   - Never mask errors with try/except unless absolutely necessary

2. **Deep Root Cause Analysis**:
   - When errors occur, trace to the fundamental cause
   - Look for patterns that indicate architectural issues
   - Consider how the fix can improve overall code quality
   - Document findings for future reference

3. **Uniform High-Quality Solutions**:
   - Avoid cheap patches and band-aid fixes
   - Implement systematic solutions that benefit the entire codebase
   - Remove cruft and technical debt when discovered
   - Maintain consistency across all components

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Each bug fix should leave the code better than before
   - Use refactoring opportunities to simplify and clarify
   - Update tests to prevent regression
   - Document lessons learned in specs/findings/

5. **Example: Iterator Z3 Boolean Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Symbolic expressions error with iterate=2
   - **Analysis**: Z3 model.evaluate() returns different types
   - **Solution**: Systematic _evaluate_z3_boolean method
   - **Result**: Improved robustness across all theories

## Implementation Process

### Core Process Requirements

Each phase of implementation MUST follow this systematic approach:

1. **Research and Design Phase** (Before Implementation)
   - Analyze the current codebase structure
   - Identify all dependencies and potential impacts
   - Design the implementation approach
   - Create a detailed implementation plan
   - Document the plan in a separate spec file
   - Review and refine the plan

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Follow the approved implementation plan
   - Use dual testing methodology throughout
   - Keep the plan updated with actual progress
   - Document any deviations or discoveries

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Verify no regressions
   - Document outcomes in findings/

### Implementation Plan Documentation

Each major phase should have its own implementation plan document:
- Location: `docs/specs/plans/0XX_<phase_name>_implementation.md`
- Contents:
  - Problem analysis
  - Design decisions
  - Step-by-step implementation guide
  - Testing protocols
  - Risk assessment
  - Success criteria

### Progress Tracking

1. **Main Plan Updates**: This document (008) should be updated to reflect:
   - Completion status of each phase
   - Links to implementation plans
   - Key outcomes and decisions
   - Any changes to future phases based on learnings

2. **Implementation Plan Updates**: Individual implementation plans should track:
   - Completed steps with timestamps
   - Issues encountered and resolutions
   - Test results at each step
   - Final validation results

### Example: Phase 1 Process

Phase 1 demonstrates the improved process:
1. **Initial Problem**: Iterator regression discovered during refactoring
2. **Research Phase**: Investigated root cause (Z3 boolean evaluation)
3. **Design Phase**: Created Plan 010 with detailed migration strategy
4. **Implementation**: Followed plan systematically with dual testing
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing confirmed success
6. **Documentation**: Finding 011 captured outcomes and learnings

This approach prevented issues and ensured zero regressions.

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY AND FIX DURING PHASE 2**: 

**Problem Identified**: During Phase 2 work, discovered a critical regression in the iterator framework where MODEL 2+ were showing empty verifier/falsifier sets (< ∅, ∅ >). Investigation revealed that the iterator was extracting 0 original constraints from the solver, causing semantically invalid models.

**Root Cause**: Iterator's `_create_extended_constraints()` method was failing to preserve original semantic constraints from `build_example.model_constraints.all_constraints`, resulting in Z3 models built with only difference constraints.

**Solution Implemented**: Modified `BaseModelIterator.__init__` to preserve original constraints and updated `_create_extended_constraints()` to use preserved constraints instead of failed solver extraction. This changed MODEL 2 from having 0 original constraints to 34, fixing the empty verifier/falsifier issue.

**Impact**: This fix resolved a v1.0 release blocker that affected all theories using `iterate > 1`. The solution demonstrates the debugging philosophy of systematic improvement - turning a bug discovery into a framework enhancement.

- **Plan 013**: [Iterator Constraint Extraction Fix](013_iterator_constraint_extraction_fix.md)

**Phase 2 Summary**:
- **Duration**: 7 phases completed successfully  
- **Architecture**: Modular utility components prepared for future integration
- **Functionality**: Full backward compatibility maintained, no breaking changes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive validation - 84+ tests passing, all examples working
- **Critical Fix**: Iterator constraint preservation bug resolved
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Major v1.0 blocker resolved

### Phase 3: Syntactic.py Refactoring (7 days)

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress - Phase 3.1 Complete, Migration Strategy Updated
**Implementation Plan**: [014_syntactic_refactoring_plan.md](014_syntactic_refactoring_plan.md)
**Update**: User requested removal of syntactic.py and utils.py, rename utils_new to utils

#### Phase 3.0: Research and Design (Day 1) ✅ COMPLETE

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan: `docs/specs/plans/014_syntactic_refactoring_plan.md`
   - Analyzed syntactic.py structure (895 lines) with detailed component breakdown
   - Designed modular subpackage organization for operator hierarchy
   - Created migration strategy preserving theory compatibility across all theories
   - Included comprehensive testing protocols for operator functionality
   - Risk assessment covering parser changes and operator integration
   
2. ✅ Applied lessons learned from Phases 1-2:
   - Conservative splitting approach to minimize cross-module dependencies
   - Dual testing methodology emphasizing operator functionality validation
   - Special attention to theory-specific operator requirements and integration

#### Phase 3.1: Setup and Baseline (Day 1) ✅ COMPLETE

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Created comprehensive baseline for syntactic functionality
   - Captured parsing output for all theories: logos, exclusion, imposition, bimodal
   - Captured parsing output for all subtheories: modal, counterfactual, constitutive, extensional, relevance
   - Baseline files stored in docs/specs/baselines/phase3/
   
2. ✅ Mapped all syntactic dependencies across theories
   - Found 49 import locations across codebase
   - Documented in docs/specs/baselines/phase3/syntactic_imports.txt
   - Identified critical integration points for refactoring
   
3. ✅ Created test infrastructure for syntactic package
   - Test files prepared: test_atoms.py, test_sentence.py, test_operators.py, test_syntax.py
   - Validation framework: test_refactoring_validation.py
   - Following NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY principle from CLAUDE.md
   - Test infrastructure plan: docs/specs/plans/015_syntactic_test_infrastructure.md
   
4. ✅ Fixed iterate package tests as requested by user
   - Updated mock creation in test_base_iterator.py to include model_constraints
   - All 10 iterate tests now passing (9 skipped by design)

5. ✅ Iterator refactoring completed successfully
   - Implemented structural variables iterator plan (017)
   - Fixed Z3 namespace conflicts and proposition linkage issues
   - Created comprehensive iterator documentation following maintenance standards
   - All theories now successfully produce MODEL 2 with iteration

**Critical Focus**: Since syntactic.py contains the core operator system used by all theories, baseline capture must be comprehensive to catch any regressions in operator parsing, registration, or formula processing.


#### Phase 3.2: Utils/Syntactic Migration Strategy (NEW)

**User Request**: Remove syntactic.py and utils.py completely, rename utils_new to utils

**Migration Analysis**:

1. **Utils.py Status**:
   - Core functions already migrated to utils_new: parse_expression, op_left_right, bitvector ops, ForAll/Exists, Z3ContextManager
   - Missing functions that need migration:
     - get_model_checker_version, get_license_template (used by project generator)
     - not_implemented_string (used by proposition.py)
     - pretty_set_print (used by iterate modules)
     - get_theory, get_example (used by meta_data.py and tests)
     - flatten (utility function)
     - run_test, run_enhanced_test, run_strategy_test, TestResultData (testing utilities)
     - check_theory_compatibility, get_theory_version (version checking)

2. **Syntactic.py Status**:
   - 895 lines containing core operator system
   - 15 files import from syntactic
   - Key components: Sentence, Operator classes, Syntax, OperatorCollection
   - Critical for all theory implementations

3. **Dependencies**:
   - syntactic.py imports from utils.py (bitvec_to_substates, parse_expression, op_left_right)
   - Many theories import from both modules
   - Circular dependency risk if not carefully managed

**Migration Completed**:

1. **Step 1: Complete utils_new** ✅ DONE
   - Created utils_new/api.py for get_theory, get_example
   - Created utils_new/version.py for version/compatibility functions
   - Created utils_new/formatting.py for pretty_set_print, not_implemented_string, flatten
   - Created utils_new/testing.py for test runner functions
   - Updated utils_new/__init__.py to export all functions

2. **Step 2: Update all imports** ✅ DONE
   - Updated 34 files from utils to utils_new
   - All imports working correctly

3. **Step 3: Rename utils_new to utils** ✅ DONE
   - Removed old utils.py
   - Renamed directory successfully
   - Updated imports back to utils
   - All tests passing

4. **Step 4: Handle syntactic.py** 🟡 DECISION PENDING
   - Option A: Keep syntactic.py for now (lower risk) ← RECOMMENDED
   - Option B: Create syntactic/ subpackage following original plan
   - Option C: Merge into existing packages (highest risk)
   
**Recommendation**: Keep syntactic.py as-is for v1.0 release. It's stable, working, and all theories depend on it. Refactoring can be done post-v1.0 with lower risk.

**Risks**:
- Import failures if not done atomically
- Missing functionality if functions not properly migrated
- Test failures if testing utilities not preserved

#### Phase 3.2-3.4: Incremental Migration (Days 2-4) - REVISED

**NEW APPROACH**: Complete utils migration first, then evaluate syntactic.py options

**Structure** (if proceeding with syntactic refactoring):
```
src/model_checker/syntactic/
├── sentence.py     # Sentence class
├── operators.py    # Operator base classes
├── syntax.py       # Syntax processing
├── parser.py       # Expression parsing
└── collections.py  # OperatorCollection
```

**Critical Testing**:
```bash
# Test all imports work correctly
python -c "from model_checker.utils import *"

# Test operator parsing for each theory
for theory in logos bimodal exclusion imposition; do
  pytest src/model_checker/theory_lib/$theory/tests/test_*operators.py -v
done

# Test complex formula parsing
./dev_cli.py -p src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/*/examples.py
```

### Phase 4: Subpackage Optimization (3-4 days)

**Status**: ⏳ Not Started

#### Targets:
1. **builder/module.py** (1031 lines) → Split into loader.py, executor.py, config.py
2. **iterate/core.py** (1007 lines) → Split into base.py, strategies.py, constraints.py

**Testing Focus**:
- Iterator regression testing (critical!)
- Module loading edge cases
- Cross-theory compatibility

### Phase 5: Code Quality and Cleanup (2-3 days)

**Status**: ⏳ Not Started

#### Tasks:
1. Add missing module docstrings
2. Remove TODO/FIXME comments
3. Fix import organization
4. Add type hints to public APIs

**Validation**:
```bash
# Lint checks
pylint src/model_checker --disable=all --enable=missing-docstring
mypy src/model_checker --ignore-missing-imports

# TODO/FIXME audit
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/ > remaining_todos.txt
```

### Phase 6: Documentation Completion (2-3 days)

**Status**: ⏳ Not Started

#### Tasks:
1. Ensure every directory has README.md
2. Generate API documentation
3. Verify all cross-references
4. Update user guides

### Phase 7: Final Testing and Release Prep (3-4 days)

**Status**: ⏳ Not Started

#### Tasks:
1. Full test coverage analysis
2. Cross-platform testing
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Create CHANGELOG.md
5. Tag v1.0.0-rc1

**Final Validation Suite - BOTH METHODS REQUIRED**:

**Automated Dual Testing Script**:
```bash
# Use the dual testing script for comprehensive validation
./scripts/dual_test_refactoring.sh
```

**Method 1 - Test Runner**:
```bash
# Complete test battery with coverage
./run_tests.py --unit --examples --package --coverage

# Performance comparison
time ./run_tests.py --examples > performance_v1.txt
```

**Method 2 - Direct CLI Testing**:
```bash
# All theories with multiple iterations
mkdir -p final_tests
for i in 1 2 3 5; do
  for theory in logos bimodal exclusion imposition; do
    echo "Testing $theory with $i iterations..."
    ./dev_cli.py -i $i src/model_checker/theory_lib/$theory/examples.py > \
      final_tests/${theory}_${i}iter.txt 2>&1
  done
done

# Check for regressions
grep -r "WARNING\|Error\|AttributeError" final_tests/ | grep -v "known_issues"

# Test all subtheories
for subtheory in constitutive counterfactual extensional modal relevance; do
  ./dev_cli.py src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/subtheories/$subtheory/examples.py > \
    final_tests/logos_${subtheory}.txt 2>&1
done

# Verify output quality
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/examples.py > final_tests/output_test.txt 2>&1
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All test runner tests pass
- [ ] No warnings/errors in ANY dev_cli.py output
- [ ] Iterator works correctly for all iteration counts
- [ ] Performance within 5% of baseline
- [ ] All subtheories execute without errors
