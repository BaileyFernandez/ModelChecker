    # M: is it fair to assume that all models will have
    # possible states, and all models will have a definition for worlds?
    # B: possible states are hard to avoid. even in an extensional semantics where there is just 
    # 1 and 0 as semantic values, the 1 may be thought to be possible (indeed actual). in finite
    # models as we have here, there will be maximal possible states which are worlds states. what
    # is less clear is whether every user will care to work with world states, although I think
    # it is extremely likely that they will. so basically, yes, probably no matter what, every
    # user will want to work with possible states and world states. certainly all of the models
    # in my semantics will have both. officially, there is required to be at least one possible
    # state, where every possible state is a part of a world state.
    # M: sounds good! so maybe we proceed with assuming everyone wants both and then once everything
    # is working we see if there's a way to not make people assume that? alternatively we could
    # figure out a specific trivial definition for worlds so that if someone doesn't want them
    # they can just use that to no detriment. 

    # M: there needs to be a general formula for what an interpretation is.
    # B: when sentence letters are assigned to propositions, this amounts to interpreting them.
    # so really the Proposition class says what it is to interpret a sentence letter.

    # M: looking at find_complex_proposition, it looks like we can employ a similar strategy
    # to the operators bouncing back and forth with the semantics, except this time we
    # bounce back and forth with wherever the definition of a proposition is
    # B: yes, there will definitely also be some bouncing back and forth. whatever happens in
    # recursive_print will get divided between operators

    # M: Right now we explicitly save the extension of some functions (verify, falsifyâ€”in,
    # atomic_props_dict). it would be nice if we could choose not to.
    # B: I agree, this would be good to discuss

    # M: to be honest the entirety of the state space is user-dependent. The only thing that we could
    # do is maybe save the extensions of all the functions. Tbh, not that much for small values of N.
    # you could then save all those extensions and when you're evaluating you'd just need to check
    # if a specific set of values is in the extension of the given function. Now the problem is,
    # how do we know for a generic case what the name of a given function is? Maybe it is better
    # instead to rely on a method that is like the current evaluate one but for functions.
    # as a concrete example take find_compatible_parts in model_definitions rn. Right now,
    # to find what bits are compatible with a world, you check if some things are in the
    # extension of other things. With the new implementation, you would simply do
    # z3_model.evaluate(compatible_parts)
    # B: this is interesting and worth discussing
    # M: I tried this, it didn't work because it actually takes a lot of computational power.
    # (and I think we actually discussed and discarded a similar strategy back in February
    # when things were getting started)
    # M: It turns out that even for small values of N saving the extensions of function is a lot,
    # since there are a couple functions that would take 3 inputs (e.g. is_alternative), which has
    # inputs in R^3, meaning, with e.g. N=7 there are (2^7)^3 = 2 million different input combos.
    # Even worse, in that strategy you'd create a constraint for every single combination of
    # bits in the space R^n for n the number of arguments taken by the function.
    # so for N=7 and a 3-place predicate, you'd create a constraint that is itself a conjunction of
    # 2 million constraintsâ€”in tests Z3 was taking too long for that (I never saw it terminate)
    # B: oh got it. but well worth thinking through!

    # how about you just don't worry about all that stuff? Like, focus on the extensional case.
    # all that crap only matters for the later stuff anyways.
    # B: good to anticipate what will be needed later on to save trouble then
    # M: that is true, sorry this comment was meant to myself and i probably should have worded
    # better anyways lol
    # M: I also have a better idea of how that would lookâ€”just before I was kind of lost
    # B: that's a part of it! it's shaping up very nicely :)
