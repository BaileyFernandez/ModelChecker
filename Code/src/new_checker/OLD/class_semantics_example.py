'''
example of what a user would do to create their own semantics following idea explained in
docstring of class_operator_playground.

First, they create a class that is a subclass of the Frame class with all special definitions
they need methods, and any other definitions as attributes (a couple are mandatory).

Then they create a Frame object of that type by defining N. Then they add operators to it with
whatever info they determine an operator needs (this is very loose, can be really whatever they
want at this point, so long as its consistent with their true_at definitions). 

Generally an upside of this approach is that it is very flexible. There are few minimal things
required by a Frame. However this flexibility is also a downside: this file is quite long, at
about 200 lines. Additionally some of the functions the user must currently define are not in Z3
but rather involve substantial python, which makes it not that friendly since if a user only had to
make methods that were pure Z3, they wouldn't need that much python experience. For example the true_at
and false_at functions both have recursion and accessing things from a dict. These are things that
presumably every semantics should have (at leaset bilateral semantics) so maybe those can be moved
to the Frame class as opposed to being required to be defined by the user in their new frame subclass.
(M: I am not sure what those things are, this is my guess at tha, but that would be a major design
choice in this approach)

# B: modularity would be helped if operator classes could be defined independent of a frame

    # M: (writing this after writing below comment) if the operators are classes, then the true_at and similar
    # methods would need a frame as input to access the Z3 possible, verify, falsify functions for that
    # frame (or it would need whatever bigger object that houses those things). I think that's possible

# B: if need be, we might consider defining something general which both the frame and operators could reference

    # M: I think that would end up being necessary, because operators need to reference things like possible,
    # verify, falsify etc, which are currently housed in the frame (that is really the only reason
    # for the current organization

# B: the reason for wanting the operators to be independent of the constraints on a proposition etc., is so
# that one could potentially compare frames using the same operators in just the same way that one could compare
# operators over the same frame in order to facilitate systematic comparisons between systems

# M: You could add operators more modularly doing the following:
negation = {'name': '\\neg',
            'true_at': lambda arg, ref_frame, eval_world: ref_frame.false_at(arg, eval_world),
                   'false_at': lambda arg, ref_frame, eval_world: ref_frame.true_at(arg, eval_world),
                   'arity': 1}
# now say you have two frames, frame1 and frame2 (pretend one of them is not a BrastMcKieFrame)
frame1 = BrastMcKieFrame(3)
frame2 = BrastMcKieFrame(3)
# now you can do (using the current syntax, though it could be changed to be prettier as follows
frame1.add_operator(negation['name'], negation) # add_operator could be changed to make the function call
                                                # be frame1.add_operator(negation)
frame2.add_operator(negation['name'], negation)

# M: Would need to change the def of true_at of the Frame class to include the frame being passed into
# the operator's true_at "method" (in quotations bc its a dict rn)

# M: I'm having trouble thinking of a way to turn this into a class because if you have an operator
# that needs methods additional to those of other operators, you'd need to define a new subclass (or
# change the definition of the Operator class). However if the methods operators need to have do not
# depend on the frame, then making the class would be easy since you'd never need to add any methods
# to the class.
# B: it would be great if we can define operators in a frame independent way
