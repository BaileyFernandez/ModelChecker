# B: right now no settings are passed in but that would add four more arguments.
# I know that is not too many, but it is enough where it becomes hard to keep track.
# to keep things easy for users, I think it would help to store all inputs in a class to pass in.
# the class could have a bunch of defaults which are changed if a user specifies settings.
# I think the Inputs class should include premises, conclusions, and all settings.
# right now we don't have too many settings, but it is likely these will continue to grow.
# M: yeah, I can see that making sense now that at a bare minimum five inputs are necessary
# for a ModelSetup instance. I'm wondering though if an Input class would just be kicking
# problem to the Input class? (Now, the Input instance would have x>5 input necessary)
# (Unless you had implementing the settings in there sequentially in mind)
# What if we kept like premises and conclusions in the ModelSetup and everything 
# else in the Input class? Because a specific Input object with just semantics, operators, and
# Propositions is very reusableâ€”in fact, it would make testing more than one theorem
# very readable (so in this conception premises, conclusions, and an Input instance are passed
# to the ModelSetup constructor). This slightly reduces the nuber of arguments passed into
# the input class at least?
