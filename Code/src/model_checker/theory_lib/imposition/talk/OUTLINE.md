# OUTLINE

- intro (5 min)
  - motivation: standard methodology
  - hard, slow, error prone
  - difficult to scale the expressive power of the language
- programmatic semantics (10 min)
  - SMT solvers (Z3)
  - bitvectors as states
  - primitive sorts in Z3
  - DEMO IMPOSITION SEMANTICS
    - run example
    - theory unit tests
  - model-checker to facilitate
- imposition relation (10 min)
  - cost of a primitive scales with arity
  - compare one-place, two-place, and three-place
  - other?
  - DEMO MAXIMIZER FOR IMPOSITION SEMANTICS
- imposition defined (5 min)
  - maximal compatible parts
  - alternative worlds
  - semantics for counterfactuals
  - DEMO COMPARISON AND UNIT TESTS
- modality defined (5 min)
  - `\Box A := \top \boxright A` rather than `\Box A := \neg A \boxright \bot`
  - iterated modals don't force counterfactuals into the antecedent
  - intuitive reading: if anything were the case, A would be the case
  - imposition theory admits countermodels to this definition
