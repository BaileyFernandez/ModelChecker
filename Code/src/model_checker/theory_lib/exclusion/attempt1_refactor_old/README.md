# Attempt 1: Refactoring Original Strategy

## Overview
**Date Range**: July 2024  
**Status**: Incomplete - False premises persist  
**Key Innovation**: Implementing correct recursive semantics with Skolem functions

## Goals
- [x] Analyze recursive reduction failures in original strategy
- [x] Implement Skolemized functions for exclusion operator
- [ ] Fix false premise issue in 8 problematic examples
- [ ] Maintain modularity for operator extensibility

## Approach
Following the implementation_plan.md, this attempt focused on:
- Ensuring proper recursive reduction to semantic primitives
- Using Skolem functions (h_sk, y_sk) to handle existential quantification
- Maintaining the two-case pattern (atomic vs complex sentences)
- No operator hardcoding in semantic functions

## Implementation Details
- **Strategy**: Skolemized (SK) functions for three-condition exclusion
- **Key Files**:
  - `semantic.py`: Based on semantic_old.py with recursive fixes
  - `operators.py`: SK implementation of exclusion operator
  - `examples.py`: Test examples

## Results

### What Worked
- Successfully implemented Skolem functions
- Maintained proper modularity
- Fixed circular dependency issues

### What Didn't Work
- All 8 problematic examples still showed false premises
- The disconnect between constraint generation and truth evaluation persisted

### Test Results
```
Total Examples: 34
False Premises: 8
Success Rate: 76.5%
Average Time: 0.838s
```

- [`docs/TODO.md`](docs/TODO.md): Task tracking for this attempt

## Running This Attempt
```bash
cd /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ModelChecker/Code
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/attempt1_refactor_old/examples.py
```

## Key Learnings
1. Skolem functions alone don't solve the false premise issue
2. The problem appears deeper than just implementation strategy
3. Circular dependencies must be carefully avoided

## Why This Attempt Was Abandoned
Despite correct implementation of Skolem functions, the false premise issue persisted, suggesting the problem might be in the semantic theory itself or in how Z3 interprets the constraints.
