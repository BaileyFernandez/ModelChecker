# Exclusion Theory: Witness Implementation for Unilateral Semantics

## Overview

This directory implements Bernard and Champollion's unilateral exclusion theory within the ModelChecker's **three-fold programmatic semantic methodology**: **Syntax → Truth-Conditions → Extensions**. This contrasts with the bilateral semantics approach developed by Kit Fine and Benjamin Brast-McKie, as exemplified in the logos theory.

### Semantic Approaches
- **Unilateral Semantics** (Bernard & Champollion): Propositions have only verifiers; negation emerges through an exclusion relation between states
- **Bilateral Semantics** (Fine & Brast-McKie): Propositions have both verifiers and falsifiers; negation is primitive

The exclusion theory provides a case study in how semantic theories requiring existential quantification interact with the three-level architecture of computational model checking. The implementation reveals fundamental insights about information flow between syntax (sentence objects), truth-conditions (Z3 constraints), and extensions (Z3 models), particularly how different architectural patterns enable or prevent the circular information flow required by complex semantic theories.

**Key Achievement**: All 41 test examples now execute correctly, with 18 theorems validated and 23 countermodels properly identified.

## The Three-Level Methodology

The ModelChecker implements a systematic methodology transforming between three fundamental levels:

1. **Syntax Level**: Sentence objects, AST structures, formula representations
2. **Truth-Conditions Level**: Z3 constraints, logical requirements, semantic primitives  
3. **Extensions Level**: Z3 models, concrete interpretations, state spaces

The exclusion theory requires **circular information flow** between all three levels, making it an ideal test case for architectural approaches to programmatic semantics.

## The Innovation: Witness Functions as Model Predicates

### The Core Idea

Traditional approaches treated witness functions as temporary artifacts during constraint generation. Our innovation makes them persistent, queryable predicates within the Z3 model itself:

```python
class WitnessAwareModel:
    def get_h_witness(self, formula_str: str, state: int) -> Optional[int]:
        """
        Get h(state) for the given formula.
        This is the key method that makes witnesses accessible.
        """
        h_pred = self.witness_predicates.get(f"{formula_str}_h")
        if h_pred is None:
            return None
            
        # Query the witness predicate
        state_bv = z3.BitVecVal(state, self.semantics.N)
        result = self.eval(h_pred(state_bv))
        if z3.is_bv_value(result):
            return result.as_long()
        return None
```

This simple change enables the model to answer questions about witness mappings after Z3 has solved the constraints.

### Why This Matters

The unilateral negation operator `¬A` has complex semantics involving existential quantification:
- A state verifies `¬A` if there exist witness functions h and y satisfying three conditions
- Previous attempts lost access to these witnesses after constraint generation
- Without witnesses, we couldn't compute verifiers correctly during truth evaluation

## Current Status & Key Documents

### Essential Reading

- **[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md)** - Complete analysis emphasizing three-level methodology and information flow patterns
- **[Incremental Architecture Plan](attempt6_incremental/incremental_modeling.md)** - Detailed plan for maintaining circular three-level information flow
- **[Three-Level Journey](attempt6_incremental/docs/syntax_semantics.md)** - Step-by-step analysis of the syntax → truth-conditions → extensions process

### Implementation Journey

The development process uncovered that the persistent false premise issue stems from **static linear information flow** (Syntax → Truth-Conditions → Extensions) rather than the **incremental circular information flow** (Syntax ⇄ Truth-Conditions ⇄ Extensions) required by exclusion semantics. After eight failed attempts, the breakthrough came by making witness functions first-class model citizens.

## Architecture

### 1. Registry Pattern for Consistency

The `WitnessRegistry` ensures witness functions remain consistent across all phases:

```python
class WitnessRegistry:
    def register_witness_predicates(self, formula_str: str):
        """Register h and y predicates for a formula."""
        h_name = f"{formula_str}_h"
        y_name = f"{formula_str}_y"
        
        # Create Z3 functions for witness predicates
        h_pred = z3.Function(h_name, z3.BitVecSort(self.N), z3.BitVecSort(self.N))
        y_pred = z3.Function(y_name, z3.BitVecSort(self.N), z3.BitVecSort(self.N))
        
        self.predicates[h_name] = h_pred
        self.predicates[y_name] = y_pred
        
        return h_pred, y_pred
```

### 2. Clean Two-Phase Separation

We maintain the ModelChecker's two-phase architecture:

**Phase 1: Constraint Generation**
- Establish witness mappings via Z3 constraints
- Register witness predicates in the model
- Generate three-condition semantics constraints

**Phase 2: Truth Evaluation**
- Query established witness mappings
- Compute verifiers using witness values
- Determine truth at evaluation points

### 3. Modular Operator Design

Each operator is self-contained with full semantic implementation:

```python
class UniNegationOperator(Operator):
    def compute_verifiers(self, argument, model, eval_point):
        """Compute verifiers by querying witness predicates."""
        # Get formula string for witness lookup
        formula_str = f"\\exclude({self.semantics._formula_to_string(argument)})"
        
        verifiers = []
        for state in range(2**self.semantics.N):
            if self._verifies_uninegation_with_predicates(
                state, formula_str, arg_verifiers, model
            ):
                verifiers.append(state)
        return verifiers
```

## How to Use

### Basic Example

```python
from model_checker.theory_lib.exclusion import (
    WitnessSemantics,
    WitnessProposition,
    WitnessStructure,
    witness_operators
)

# Define the theory
exclusion_theory = {
    "semantics": WitnessSemantics,
    "proposition": WitnessProposition,
    "model": WitnessStructure,
    "operators": witness_operators,
    "dictionary": {}
}

# Create an example
NEG_TO_SENT = [
    ["A"],           # Premise: A
    ["\\exclude A"],  # Conclusion: ¬A
    {"N": 3}         # Settings
]

# The system will correctly find a countermodel
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run current exclusion theory implementation
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/examples.py

# Run with specific settings
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/examples.py
```

## Test Results Summary

### Theorems (18 total)
- Basic atomic inference: `A ⊢ A`
- Distribution laws: `A ∧ (B ∨ C) ⊢ (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)`
- Absorption laws: `A ⊢ A ∧ (A ∨ B)`
- Associativity laws: `A ∧ (B ∧ C) ⊢ (A ∧ B) ∧ C`
- Identity principles: `⊢ (A ∧ (B ∨ C)) ≡ ((A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C))`

### Countermodels (23 total)
- Negation principles: `A ⊢ ¬A` (correctly fails)
- Double negation: `¬¬A ⊢ A` (correctly fails)
- DeMorgan's laws (all four forms find countermodels)
- Various frame constraints

## Theoretical Significance

### For Programmatic Semantics

The exclusion theory demonstrates how **architectural patterns** in computational systems embody **methodological commitments** about the relationship between syntax, truth-conditions, and extensions. The choice between static linear and incremental circular information flow reflects deeper computational commitments about:

- The role of computational context in semantic evaluation
- The relationship between logical requirements and concrete interpretations
- The nature of truth-condition artifacts and their accessibility

### For Model Checking Architecture

The investigation reveals that some semantic theories require **persistent computational context** across all three levels of the methodology. This suggests that model checking architectures should be designed with **information flow patterns** as a first-class architectural concern.

## Key Technical Details

### 1. Correct Quantifier Usage

We use custom quantifiers from `model_checker.utils` for predictable behavior:

```python
from model_checker.utils import Exists, ForAll

# Correct constraint ordering
return Exists(
    [x1, x2],
    z3.And(
        self.semantics.fusion(x1, x2) == state,  # fusion first
        self.semantics.extended_verify(x1, arg1, eval_point),
        self.semantics.extended_verify(x2, arg2, eval_point),
    )
)
```

### 2. Method-Based Semantic Relations

Following ModelChecker patterns, we use methods not Z3 primitives:

```python
def conflicts(self, bit_e1, bit_e2):
    """Check if two states conflict."""
    f1, f2 = z3.BitVecs("f1 f2", self.N)
    return Exists(
        [f1, f2],
        z3.And(
            self.is_part_of(f1, bit_e1),
            self.is_part_of(f2, bit_e2),
            self.excludes(f1, f2),
        ),
    )
```

### 3. Framework Integration

Proper inheritance and method signatures ensure compatibility:

```python
class WitnessSemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    def _premise_behavior_method(self, premise):
        """Premise must be true at main evaluation point."""
        return self.true_at(premise, self.main_point)

    def _conclusion_behavior_method(self, conclusion):
        """Conclusion must be false at main evaluation point."""
        return z3.Not(self.true_at(conclusion, self.main_point))
```

## Why Previous Attempts Failed

1. **Attempts 1-5**: Lost witness information after constraint generation
2. **Attempt 6**: IncCtx approach became too complex to manage
3. **Attempt 7**: Functions defined but not queryable during evaluation
4. **Attempt 8**: Lacked proper infrastructure for witness management

## Performance Characteristics

- **Constraint Complexity**: Slightly increased due to witness predicate constraints
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead from storing witness functions
- **Query Performance**: Direct function evaluation is fast
- **Overall Impact**: Negligible performance cost for correctness gain

## Future Extensions

1. **Optimization**: Cache witness queries for repeated evaluations
2. **Visualization**: Display witness mappings in model output
3. **Generalization**: Apply pattern to other semantic challenges
4. **Theory**: Explore implications of predicates as model citizens

## Module Architecture
