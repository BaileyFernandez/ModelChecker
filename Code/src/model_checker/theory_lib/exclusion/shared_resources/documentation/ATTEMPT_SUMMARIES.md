# Summary of Each Attempt

## Attempt 1: Original Multi-Strategy Implementation
**Date**: Pre-July 2024  
**Files**: semantic_old.py, operators_old.py  
**Key Features**: 
- 12 different exclusion strategies (QA, QI, QI2, BQI, NF, NA, SK, CD, MS, UF, WD)
- MS (Multi-Sort) as default
- Complex strategy registry system
**Result**: 8 examples with false premises

## Attempt 2: Skolem Function Implementation  
**Date**: July 2024  
**Files**: sk_*.py files  
**Key Features**:
- Focus on Skolemized (SK) strategy
- Attempted to fix circular dependencies
- Multiple iterations (sk_exclusion.py → sk_exclusion_correct.py)
**Result**: All 8 problematic examples still had false premises

## Attempt 3: Reduced/Recursive Semantics
**Date**: July 2024  
**Files**: reduced_*.py files  
**Key Features**:
- Clean separation of primitives (only verify and excludes)
- Proper recursive reduction
- Simplified implementation
**Result**: Same 8 false premises, but 4.3x performance improvement

## Attempt 4: Simplified Single-Strategy
**Date**: January 2025 (Phase 2)  
**Files**: semantic_simplified.py, operators_simplified.py  
**Key Features**:
- Removed multi-strategy complexity
- 70% code reduction
- Single SK strategy
- Fixed print functionality
**Result**: 10 false premises (2 new regressions), but much cleaner code

## Attempt 5: Current Implementation with Skolem Investigation
**Date**: January 2025 (Phase 3)  
**Files**: Current semantic.py, operators.py  
**Key Features**:
- Based on simplified version
- Investigated Skolem function limitation
- Documented architectural flaw
**Result**: Identified fundamental limitation - issue cannot be fixed without architectural changes

## Key Evolution Points

1. **Multi-Strategy → Single Strategy**: Realized multiple strategies didn't help
2. **Complex → Simple**: Code reduction made the problem clearer
3. **Implementation Focus → Architectural Understanding**: Discovered it's not a bug but a limitation
4. **Fixing → Documenting**: Shifted from trying to fix to understanding why it can't be fixed
