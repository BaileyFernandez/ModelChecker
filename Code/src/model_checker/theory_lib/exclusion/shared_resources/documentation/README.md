- Others: QI, BQI, NF, NA, WD

**Key Finding**: All strategies showed trade-offs between success rate and reliability.

#### 6. [strategy_analysis_PCT.md](strategy_analysis_PCT.md) - PCT Strategy Analysis
**Purpose**: Analyzes the disconnect between constraint generation and truth evaluation.

**Key Concepts**:
- Precise Constraint Translation (PCT)
- Correct recursive semantics
- Direct Computation Strategy (DCS)
- Hybrid approaches

**Key Insight**: Operator implementations don't properly reduce to verifier existence conditions.

#### 7. [future_research_directions.md](future_research_directions.md) - Alternative Approaches
**Purpose**: Outlines strategies to work around the Skolem function limitation.

**Categories**:
- A: Give up on full unilateral semantics
- B: Accept the limitation
- C: Change the model-checking architecture
- D: Alternative semantic implementations
- E: Hybrid approaches

### Implementation Documentation

#### 8. [incremental_plan.md](incremental_plan.md) - Incremental Approach (Attempt 6)
**Purpose**: Detailed plan for incremental model checking with witness extraction.

**Key Finding**: Incremental solving introduces additional bugs beyond the core limitation.

### Task Tracking

#### 9. [TODO_new_refactor.md](TODO_new_refactor.md) - Current Task List
**Purpose**: 90 tasks for refactoring current semantic.py and operators.py.

**Status**: Active task tracking (though implementation revealed fundamental limitations)

### Phase Reports (in phase_reports/)

#### Phase 2 Completion
- Successful simplification to single strategy (70% code reduction)
- Detailed test results

#### Phase 3 Completion  
- Discovery of fundamental architectural limitation
- Technical analysis of why it can't be fixed

## Recommended Reading Order

### For Understanding the Problem:

2. `strategy_analysis_original.md` - Initial strategy analysis
3. `findings.md` - What has been tried and discovered
4. `skolem_limitation.md` - Why it can't be fixed

### For Current Status:
1. `../../ATTEMPT_SUMMARIES.md` - Complete history of attempts
2. `new_implementation.md` - Latest implementation status
3. `phase_reports/phase3_completion.md` - Discovery of limitation
4. `future_research_directions.md` - Alternative approaches

### For Implementation Details:
1. `strategy_analysis_PCT.md` - Technical analysis of the core problem
2. `incremental_plan.md` - Attempt 6's sophisticated approach
3. `TODO_new_refactor.md` - Detailed task breakdown

## Key Concepts

### The Core Problem
A disconnect between how constraints are generated (Phase 1) and how truth is evaluated (Phase 2), leading to models with false premises or true conclusions.

### The Solution
Ensure that `true_at` methods correctly implement recursive reduction to verifier existence conditions, maintaining consistency between constraint generation and truth evaluation.

### Implementation Strategy
Use Skolemized Functions (SK) as the primary approach, enhanced with Constraint-Based (CD) optimizations, ultimately developing a Direct Computation Strategy (DCS) for maximum clarity and correctness.

## Contributing

When implementing changes:
1. Follow the phased approach in `implementation_plan.md`
2. Document findings in `findings.md` after each phase
3. Run comprehensive tests before proceeding to next phase
4. Update this README if new documents are added

## Current Status

### Problem Understanding
- **Theory**: Well-documented unilateral semantics with exclusion operator
- **Core Issue**: Fundamental architectural mismatch between Z3's two-phase solving and exclusion semantics
- **Root Cause**: Skolem functions from Phase 1 are inaccessible in Phase 2, preventing correct witness extraction

### Implementation History
- **6+ Attempts**: All hit the same fundamental limitation
- **Code Simplification**: 70% reduction achieved (Attempt 4)
- **Performance**: 4.3x improvement with reduced semantics (Attempt 3)
- **Test Results**: 8-10 examples consistently show false premises

### Key Discovery
- **Phase 3 Finding**: The false premise issue cannot be fixed without architectural changes
- **Attempt 6 Finding**: Incremental solving introduces additional bugs beyond the core limitation
- **Conclusion**: All strategies (QA, SK, CD, MS, etc.) fail for the same fundamental reason

### Future Directions
See [future_research_directions.md](future_research_directions.md) for alternative approaches that could work around the limitation.

## Summary: The Exclusion Semantics Journey

### What We Tried to Build
A unilateral truthmaker semantics using only verifiers (no falsifiers), with a complex three-condition exclusion operator handling negation.

### What We Discovered
Through 6+ implementation attempts, we discovered a fundamental architectural limitation:
- Z3's two-phase solving (constraint generation â†’ model extraction) prevents access to Skolem functions in Phase 2
- This makes it impossible to correctly evaluate the exclusion operator's existential conditions
- All strategies (QA, SK, CD, MS, etc.) fail for the same reason

### Key Lessons
1. **Technical**: The model checker's architecture fundamentally conflicts with exclusion semantics
2. **Philosophical**: Implementation constraints can reveal deep theoretical insights
3. **Practical**: Sometimes the best outcome is understanding why something can't work

### Current State
- The limitation is well-understood and documented
- Code has been simplified by 70% for clarity
- Future work must either accept the limitation or change the architecture

For the complete research trajectory and detailed findings, see the documents above.
