- [ ] Full integration complete
- [ ] Documentation finalized

### Critical Issues Discovered
- **False Premise Problem Persists**: All implementation strategies (baseline, SK, reduced) produce false premises for same 8 examples
- **Circular Dependency Resolved**: Must use `extended_verify` not `true_at` in constraint generation
- **Implementation Pattern Established**: Operators must extend base classes, not create parallel hierarchies
- **Semantic Theory Issue Identified**: The problem appears to be in the semantic theory itself, not the implementation

### Publication Readiness
- [ ] Technical results documented
- [ ] Theoretical contributions clear
- [ ] Implementation publicly available
- [ ] Reproducible experiments
