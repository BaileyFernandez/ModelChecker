# Implementation Findings

This document tracks findings from each phase of implementing correct recursive semantics for exclusion operators.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis âœ“ COMPLETED

### Date: 2025-07-02

#### Key Findings
- [x] Identified recursive reduction failures in exclusion operators
- [x] Documented constraint/evaluation disconnect causing false premises
- [x] Baseline performance metrics established

#### Test Results
```
Total Examples: 34
False Premises: 8
True Conclusions: 0
Success Rate: 76.5%
Average Time: 0.393s
```

#### Critical Issues Discovered
1. **Exclusion operators do not properly encode the three conditions recursively**
   - Current `true_at` methods directly use `extended_verify` without recursive reduction
   - This causes empty verifier sets to evaluate as true (false premises)
   - Affects all exclusion strategies: QA, QI2, SK, CD, MS, UF

2. **Eight examples produce models with false premises:**
   - DN_ELIM: `\\exclude \\exclude A` premise is false
   - TN_ENTAIL: `\\exclude \\exclude \\exclude A` premise is false
   - QN_ENTAIL: `\\exclude \\exclude \\exclude \\exclude A` premise is false
   - CONJ_DM_LR: `\\exclude (A \\uniwedge B)` premise is false
   - CONJ_DM_RL: `(\\exclude A \\univee \\exclude B)` premise is false
   - DISJ_DM_LR: `\\exclude (A \\univee B)` premise is false
   - DISJ_DM_RL: `(\\exclude A \\uniwedge \\exclude B)` premise is false
   - EX_TH_17: `\\exclude (A \\univee B)` premise is false

3. **Test infrastructure successfully created:**
   - RecursiveReductionAnalyzer traces reduction failures
   - test_recursive_semantics.py validates semantic reduction
   - run_baseline_tests.py establishes performance baseline

#### Recommendations for Phase 2
- Implement Skolemized functions to properly encode the three conditions
- Focus on fixing the 8 examples with false premises
- Ensure recursive reduction reaches verifier existence conditions
- Maintain performance comparable to baseline (0.393s average)
