# Implementation Findings

This document tracks findings from each phase of implementing correct recursive semantics for exclusion operators.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis âœ“ COMPLETED

### Date: 2025-07-02

#### Key Findings
- [x] Identified recursive reduction failures in exclusion operators
- [x] Documented constraint/evaluation disconnect causing false premises
- [x] Baseline performance metrics established

#### Test Results
```
Total Examples: 34
False Premises: 8
True Conclusions: 0
Success Rate: 76.5%
Average Time: 0.393s
```

#### Critical Issues Discovered
1. **Exclusion operators do not properly encode the three conditions recursively**
   - Current `true_at` methods directly use `extended_verify` without recursive reduction
   - This causes empty verifier sets to evaluate as true (false premises)
   - Affects all exclusion strategies: QA, QI2, SK, CD, MS, UF

2. **Eight examples produce models with false premises:**
   - DN_ELIM: `\\exclude \\exclude A` premise is false
   - TN_ENTAIL: `\\exclude \\exclude \\exclude A` premise is false
   - QN_ENTAIL: `\\exclude \\exclude \\exclude \\exclude A` premise is false
   - CONJ_DM_LR: `\\exclude (A \\uniwedge B)` premise is false
   - CONJ_DM_RL: `(\\exclude A \\univee \\exclude B)` premise is false
   - DISJ_DM_LR: `\\exclude (A \\univee B)` premise is false
   - DISJ_DM_RL: `(\\exclude A \\uniwedge \\exclude B)` premise is false
   - EX_TH_17: `\\exclude (A \\univee B)` premise is false

3. **Test infrastructure successfully created:**
   - RecursiveReductionAnalyzer traces reduction failures
   - test_recursive_semantics.py validates semantic reduction
   - run_baseline_tests.py establishes performance baseline

#### Recommendations for Phase 2
- Implement Skolemized functions to properly encode the three conditions
- Focus on fixing the 8 examples with false premises
- Ensure recursive reduction reaches verifier existence conditions
- Maintain performance comparable to baseline (0.393s average)

## Phase 2: Skolemized Functions Implementation

### Date: 2025-07-02

#### Key Findings
- [x] SK implementation attempted with multiple approaches
- [x] Circular dependency issue identified and addressed
- [x] Performance comparable to baseline maintained
- [ ] False premise issue persists despite fixes

#### Test Results (SK Implementation on 8 Problematic Examples)
```
Total Examples: 8
False Premises: 8
True Conclusions: 0
Success Rate: 0.0%
Average Time: 0.838s
```

#### Implementation Attempts and Discoveries

1. **Initial SK Implementation (sk_exclusion.py)**
   - Created new operator classes: SK_ExclusionOperator, SK_UniAndOperator, etc.
   - Used Skolem functions h_sk and y_sk to encode three conditions
   - **Issue**: Used `sem.true_at` recursively within constraint generation, creating circular dependency

2. **Circular Dependency Fix**
   - Replaced `sem.true_at` with `sem.extended_verify` in constraint generation
   - This follows the pattern used in base exclusion operators
   - **Result**: Circular dependency resolved, but false premises persist

3. **Corrected Implementation (sk_exclusion_correct.py)**
   - Properly extended ExclusionOperatorBase instead of creating new operator hierarchy
   - Implemented extended_verify method with Skolem functions
   - Maintained compatibility with existing semantic infrastructure
   - **Result**: Implementation runs correctly but false premises remain

#### Critical Insights

1. **The false premise issue appears to be deeper than implementation strategy**
   - All 8 problematic examples still show false premises
   - This suggests the issue may be in how exclusion semantics interact with Z3
   - The problem persists across different implementation approaches

2. **Key Implementation Principles Discovered**
   - Must use `extended_verify` not `true_at` during constraint generation
   - Operators should extend base classes, not create parallel hierarchies
   - Skolem functions need unique naming to avoid conflicts

3. **Performance Characteristics**
   - SK implementation maintains similar performance (0.838s vs 0.393s baseline)
   - No significant performance penalty from Skolem functions
   - Z3 handles the additional function symbols efficiently

#### Remaining Challenges
- All 8 examples still produce models with false premises
- The fundamental issue of exclusion operator recursive semantics remains unresolved
- Need to investigate whether the problem is in:
  - The three-condition encoding itself
  - How Z3 interprets the constraints
  - The evaluation of truth values after model generation
  - The interaction between exclusion and other operators
