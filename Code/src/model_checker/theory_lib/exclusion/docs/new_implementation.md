# New Implementation Plan: Refactoring semantic.py and operators.py

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the fundamental issue where exclusion theory models incorrectly have false premises or true conclusions. Based on the lessons learned from refactoring semantic_old.py and operators_old.py, we will now apply those insights to refactor the current semantic.py and operators.py modules while simplifying the multi-strategy architecture.

## Core Problem Identified

The issue stems from a disconnect between:
1. **Phase 1 (Constraint Generation)**: How Z3 constraints are generated when building models
2. **Phase 2 (Truth Evaluation)**: How truth values are evaluated post-hoc on found models

This disconnect manifests as:
- Models where premises evaluate to false (violating `premise_behavior`)
- Models where conclusions evaluate to true (violating `conclusion_behavior`)

## Strategic Simplification

### Current Architecture Issues
The current operators.py contains 12 different exclusion operator strategies:
- ExclusionOperatorBase (abstract base)
- ExclusionOperatorQuantifyArrays (QA)
- ExclusionOperatorQuantifyIndices (QI)
- ExclusionOperatorQuantifyIndices2 (QI2)
- ExclusionOperatorBoundedQuantifyIndices (BQI)
- ExclusionOperatorNameFunctions (NF)
- ExclusionOperatorNameArrays (NA)
- ExclusionOperatorSkolemized (SK)
- ExclusionOperatorConstraintBased (CD)
- ExclusionOperatorMultiSort (MS) - current default
- ExclusionOperatorUninterpreted (UF)
- ExclusionOperatorWitnessDriven (WD)

This proliferation of strategies makes debugging and maintenance extremely difficult.

### Proposed Simplification
Based on the learnings from reduced_semantics.md:
1. **Select Skolemized (SK) strategy** as the foundation - it's conceptually clearest
2. **Enhance with custom quantifiers** from utils (Exists/ForAll) for predictable behavior
3. **Remove all other strategies** to focus on correct implementation
4. **Eventually integrate CD optimizations** if performance requires

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Complete Recursive Reduction
Every formula must reduce to constraints on Z3 primitives:
- `verify(state, atom)` - Z3 Function for atomic verification
- `excludes(state1, state2)` - Z3 Function for exclusion relation
- `main_world` - Z3 BitVec for evaluation world

### 2. Consistent Evaluation
The `true_at` method must recursively reduce formulas to verifier existence:
```python
# Atomic case
exists v. verify(v, atom) AND is_part_of(v, world)

# Complex case  
operator.true_at(*arguments, eval_point)
```

### 3. Clean Separation
Maintain strict separation between:
- **Semantic primitives** (Z3 declarations)
- **Derived relations** (fusion, is_part_of)
- **Operator logic** (recursive reduction)

## Phase 3: Implement Correct Recursive Semantics (5-6 hours)

### Objectives
- Fix the core recursive reduction issue
- Ensure consistent constraint generation and evaluation
- Use custom quantifiers for predictability

### Key Issues to Address (from Phase 2 Testing)
1. **False Premise Examples** (10 total):
   - Exclusion operator returns empty verifier sets when it shouldn't
   - Examples: ¬¬A, ¬¬¬A, ¬(A∧B), (¬A∨¬B), etc.
   
2. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - true_at already uses custom Exists for atoms (good)
   - extended_verify already delegates properly (good)
   - ExclusionOperator uses ForAll from utils (good)
   - But verifier computation still disconnected from constraints
   
3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The three-condition Skolemized implementation generates correct constraints
   - But find_verifiers doesn't properly evaluate these constraints
   - Need to ensure truth evaluation matches constraint generation

### Tasks

#### 3.1 Fix Atomic Reduction in semantic.py
```python
def true_at(self, sentence, eval_point):
    if sentence.sentence_letter is not None:
        # Use unique variable name to avoid conflicts
        v = z3.BitVec(f"v_atom_{id(sentence)}_{self.counter}", self.N)
        self.counter += 1
        return Exists([v], z3.And(
            self.verify(v, sentence.sentence_letter),
            self.is_part_of(v, eval_point["world"])
        ))
    else:
        return sentence.operator.true_at(*sentence.arguments, eval_point)
```

#### 3.2 Fix extended_verify in semantic.py
```python
def extended_verify(self, state, sentence, eval_point):
    if sentence.sentence_letter is not None:
        return self.verify(state, sentence.sentence_letter)
    else:
        return sentence.operator.extended_verify(state, *sentence.arguments, eval_point)
```

#### 3.3 Update Exclusion Operator
- Ensure unique Skolem function names
- Use custom quantifiers (Exists/ForAll from utils)
- Implement three conditions correctly
- Remove find_verifiers method (or fix to match constraints)

#### 3.4 Fix Other Operators
- UniAndOperator: Ensure proper recursive calls
- UniOrOperator: Ensure proper recursive calls  
- UniIdentityOperator: Fix extended_verify implementation

### Deliverables
- Corrected true_at implementation
- Corrected extended_verify implementation
- Updated operator implementations
- Proper Skolem function management

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Atomic formulas reduce to verifier existence
- [ ] All operators properly recursive
- [ ] Skolem functions have unique names
- [ ] Custom quantifiers used consistently

## Risk Mitigation

### If False Premises Persist
1. Add exhaustive logging to trace exact constraint generation
2. Compare constraints between generation and evaluation
3. Check for variable name conflicts
4. Verify quantifier expansion

### If Performance Degrades
1. Start with small N values
2. Consider hybrid approach for large domains
3. Cache computed values where possible
4. Profile to find bottlenecks

### If Integration Breaks
1. Maintain backward compatibility temporarily
2. Add adapter layer if needed
3. Update tests incrementally
4. Document breaking changes

## Success Metrics

1. **Correctness**: Zero examples with false premises or true conclusions
2. **Performance**: Average execution time < 1 second per example
3. **Simplicity**: Single strategy, clear code structure
4. **Maintainability**: Well-documented, testable implementation

## Timeline

### Original Estimates
- Phase 1: 3-4 hours (Analysis and Preparation)
- Phase 2: 4-5 hours (Simplify to Single Strategy)
- Phase 3: 5-6 hours (Implement Correct Recursive Semantics)
- Phase 4: 3-4 hours (Testing and Validation)
- Phase 5: 2-3 hours (Optimization and Documentation)

### Actual Progress
- Phase 1: ✅ Completed in ~3 hours
- Phase 2: ✅ Completed in 4 hours (extra time for print functionality)
- Phase 3: ⏳ Ready to begin
- Phase 4: ⏳ Pending
- Phase 5: ⏳ Pending

## Current Status Summary (January 2025)

### What's Working
- Single Skolemized (SK) strategy implementation
- All 32 examples run without errors
- Print functionality fully restored with original formatting
- ~70% code reduction achieved
- Clean separation of concerns

### What Needs Fixing
- 10 examples still have false premises (exclusion operator issue)
- Truth evaluation doesn't match constraint generation
- find_verifiers method needs to properly evaluate Skolem constraints

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3 to fix recursive semantics
2. Focus on aligning constraint generation with truth evaluation
3. Test fixes against the 10 problematic examples
4. Ensure no new regressions are introduced

**Total: 17-22 hours** (2-3 days of focused work)

## Key Differences from Previous Approach

1. **Working with current modules** instead of old ones
2. **Simplifying first** before fixing semantics
3. **Single strategy focus** instead of maintaining all
4. **Custom quantifiers** for predictable behavior
5. **Emphasis on testing** throughout each phase

This approach learns from the previous refactoring attempt while adapting to the current codebase structure.
