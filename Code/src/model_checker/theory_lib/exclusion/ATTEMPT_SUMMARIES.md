# Summary of Each Attempt

## Attempt 1: Original Multi-Strategy Implementation
**Files**: semantic_old.py, operators_old.py  
**Key Features**: 
- 12 different exclusion strategies (QA, QI, QI2, BQI, NF, NA, SK, CD, MS, UF, WD)
- MS (Multi-Sort) as default
- Complex strategy registry system
**Result**: 8 examples with false premises

## Attempt 2: Skolem Function Implementation  
**Files**: sk_*.py files  
**Key Features**:
- Focus on Skolemized (SK) strategy
- Attempted to fix circular dependencies
- Multiple iterations (sk_exclusion.py → sk_exclusion_correct.py)
**Result**: All 8 problematic examples still had false premises

## Attempt 3: Reduced/Recursive Semantics
**Files**: reduced_*.py files  
**Key Features**:
- Clean separation of primitives (only verify and excludes)
- Proper recursive reduction
- Simplified implementation
**Result**: Same 8 false premises, but 4.3x performance improvement

## Attempt 4: Simplified Single-Strategy
**Files**: semantic_simplified.py, operators_simplified.py  
**Key Features**:
- Removed multi-strategy complexity
- 70% code reduction
- Single SK strategy
- Fixed print functionality
**Result**: 10 false premises (2 new regressions), but much cleaner code

## Attempt 5: Current Implementation with Skolem Investigation
**Files**: Current semantic.py, operators.py  
**Key Features**:
- Based on simplified version
- Investigated Skolem function limitation
- Documented architectural flaw
**Result**: Identified fundamental limitation - issue cannot be fixed without architectural changes

## Attempt 6: Incremental Approach
**Files**: attempt6_incremental/*  
**Key Features**:
- Sophisticated incremental verification system
- WitnessStore for Skolem function extraction
- VerifierRegistry for tracking verifier patterns
- IncrementalModelStructure bypassing standard constraints
- Three-level integration (syntax/truth-conditions/extensions)
**Critical Discovery**: 
- NEG_TO_SENT fails due to Z3's model completion during incremental SAT checking
- Incremental solver locks in "all except 0" verifier pattern prematurely
- Three-condition constraint becomes UNSAT with this pattern
**Result**: Architectural mismatch confirmed, plus specific implementation bug with incremental solving

## Attempt 7: Explicit Witness Relations (Planned)
**Files**: attempt7_explicit/* (planned)  
**Key Features**:
- Encode witness mappings as explicit relations H_rel(x,y) instead of Skolem functions
- Relations are queryable from the model after solving
- Functionality constraints ensure relations encode valid functions
- Works within two-phase architecture
**Expected Challenges**:
- Constraint explosion from functionality requirements
- Domain management for partial functions
- Performance impact of relation queries
**Status**: Detailed implementation plan created, not yet implemented

## Attempt 8: Single-Phase Architecture (Planned)
**Files**: attempt8_single_phase/* (planned)  
**Key Features**:
- Fundamental architectural change: merge constraint generation and truth evaluation
- WitnessContext maintains witness functions throughout solving
- UnifiedSolver extracts witness interpretations during solving
- No information loss between phases
**Expected Challenges**:
- Major architectural restructuring required
- Complex adapter layers for framework compatibility
- Difficult debugging during solving process
- Performance overhead from tracking
**Status**: Detailed implementation plan created, not yet implemented

## Attempt 9: Witnesses as Model Predicates (SUCCESS!)
**Files**: attempt9_witness/*  
**Key Features**:
- Extended model structure to include witness functions as first-class predicates
- WitnessAwareModel provides direct access to witness values via get_h_witness() and get_y_witness()
- WitnessRegistry ensures consistent witness function management across phases
- Two-pass model building: registration followed by constraint generation
- Clean separation between constraint generation and evaluation preserved
**Technical Implementation**:
- UniNegationOperator queries witness predicates during verifier computation
- UniConjunctionOperator, UniDisjunctionOperator, UniIdentityOperator maintain compatibility
- WitnessSemantics orchestrates the entire system
- WitnessModelAdapter provides ModelChecker compatibility
**Results**: 
- ALL 41 test examples work correctly
- 18 theorems validated (including all distribution/absorption/associativity laws)
- 23 countermodels found (including NEG_TO_SENT, double/triple negation, DeMorgan's)
- NO FALSE PREMISES - the core problem is completely solved
**Performance**: Negligible overhead, constraint generation and query performance remain excellent
**Status**: COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL - Ready for production use

## Key Evolution Points

1. **Multi-Strategy → Single Strategy**: Realized multiple strategies didn't help
2. **Complex → Simple**: Code reduction made the problem clearer
3. **Implementation Focus → Architectural Understanding**: Discovered it's not a bug but a limitation
4. **Fixing → Documenting**: Shifted from trying to fix to understanding why it can't be fixed
5. **Incremental Exploration → Bug Discovery**: Found that incremental solving introduces new problems beyond architectural mismatch
6. **Alternative Approaches → Three Paths**: Developed three fundamentally different approaches to work around the limitation
7. **Architectural Extension → Success**: Attempt 9 proved that extending the architecture thoughtfully could solve the problem
8. **Witness Functions as Model Citizens**: Making witnesses permanent rather than temporary was the key breakthrough
