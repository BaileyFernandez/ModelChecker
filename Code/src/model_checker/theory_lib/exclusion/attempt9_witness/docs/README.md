# Attempt 9: Witness Implementation for Unilateral Semantics

## Overview

Attempt 9 represents a breakthrough in implementing Bernard and Champollion's unilateral semantics within the ModelChecker framework. This contrasts with the bilateral semantics approach developed by Kit Fine and Benjamin Brast-McKie, as exemplified in the logos theory.

### Semantic Approaches
- **Unilateral Semantics** (Bernard & Champollion): Propositions have only verifiers; negation emerges through an exclusion relation between states
- **Bilateral Semantics** (Fine & Brast-McKie): Propositions have both verifiers and falsifiers; negation is primitive

Attempt 9 implements the unilateral approach through witness functions as first-class model predicates. By making witness functions first-class model predicates that persist beyond constraint generation, we have successfully solved the False Premise Problem that plagued all previous attempts.

**Key Achievement**: All 41 test examples now execute correctly, with 18 theorems validated and 23 countermodels properly identified.

## The Innovation: Witness Functions as Model Predicates

### The Core Idea

Traditional approaches treated witness functions as temporary artifacts during constraint generation. Our innovation makes them persistent, queryable predicates within the Z3 model itself:

```python
class WitnessAwareModel(z3.ModelRef):
    def get_h_witness(self, formula_str: str, state: int) -> Optional[int]:
        """Get h(state) for the given formula."""
        h_pred = self.witness_predicates.get(f"{formula_str}_h")
        if h_pred is None:
            return None
        state_bv = z3.BitVecVal(state, self.semantics.N)
        result = self.eval(h_pred(state_bv))
        if z3.is_bv_value(result):
            return result.as_long()
        return None
```

This simple change enables the model to answer questions about witness mappings after Z3 has solved the constraints.

### Why This Matters

The unilateral negation operator `¬A` has complex semantics involving existential quantification:
- A state verifies `¬A` if there exist witness functions h and y satisfying three conditions
- Previous attempts lost access to these witnesses after constraint generation
- Without witnesses, we couldn't compute verifiers correctly during truth evaluation

## Architecture

### 1. Registry Pattern for Consistency

The `WitnessRegistry` ensures witness functions remain consistent across all phases:

```python
class WitnessRegistry:
    def register_witness_predicates(self, formula_str: str):
        """Register h and y predicates for a formula."""
        h_pred = z3.Function(f"{formula_str}_h", 
                            z3.BitVecSort(self.N), 
                            z3.BitVecSort(self.N))
        y_pred = z3.Function(f"{formula_str}_y", 
                            z3.BitVecSort(self.N), 
                            z3.BitVecSort(self.N))
```

### 2. Clean Two-Phase Separation

We maintain the ModelChecker's two-phase architecture:

**Phase 1: Constraint Generation**
- Establish witness mappings via Z3 constraints
- Register witness predicates in the model
- Generate three-condition semantics constraints

**Phase 2: Truth Evaluation**
- Query established witness mappings
- Compute verifiers using witness values
- Determine truth at evaluation points

### 3. Modular Operator Design

Each operator is self-contained with full semantic implementation:

```python
class UniNegationOperator(Operator):
    def compute_verifiers(self, argument, model, eval_point):
        """Compute verifiers by querying witness predicates."""
        # Get formula string for witness lookup
        formula_str = f"\\exclude({self.semantics._formula_to_string(argument)})"
        
        verifiers = []
        for state in range(2**self.semantics.N):
            if self._verifies_uninegation_with_predicates(
                state, formula_str, arg_verifiers, model
            ):
                verifiers.append(state)
        return verifiers
```

## How to Use

### Basic Example

```python
from model_checker.theory_lib.exclusion.attempt9_witness import (
    WitnessSemantics,
    WitnessProposition,
    WitnessStructure,
    witness_operators
)

# Define the theory
unilateral_theory = {
    "semantics": WitnessSemantics,
    "proposition": WitnessProposition,
    "model": WitnessStructure,
    "operators": witness_operators,
    "dictionary": {}
}

# Create an example
NEG_TO_SENT = [
    ["A"],           # Premise: A
    ["\\exclude A"],  # Conclusion: ¬A
    {"N": 3}         # Settings
]

# The system will correctly find a countermodel
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all examples
./dev_cli.py /path/to/attempt9_witness/examples.py

# Run with specific settings
./dev_cli.py -p -z /path/to/attempt9_witness/examples.py
```

## Test Results Summary

### Theorems (18 total)
- Basic atomic inference: `A ⊢ A`
- Distribution laws: `A ∧ (B ∨ C) ⊢ (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)`
- Absorption laws: `A ⊢ A ∧ (A ∨ B)`
- Associativity laws: `A ∧ (B ∧ C) ⊢ (A ∧ B) ∧ C`
- Identity principles: `⊢ (A ∧ (B ∨ C)) ≡ ((A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C))`

### Countermodels (23 total)
- Negation principles: `A ⊢ ¬A` (correctly fails)
- Double negation: `¬¬A ⊢ A` (correctly fails)
- DeMorgan's laws (all four forms find countermodels)
- Various frame constraints

## Key Technical Details

### 1. Correct Quantifier Usage

We use custom quantifiers from `model_checker.utils` for predictable behavior:

```python
from model_checker.utils import Exists, ForAll

# Correct constraint ordering
return Exists(
    [x1, x2],
    z3.And(
        self.semantics.fusion(x1, x2) == state,  # fusion first
        self.semantics.extended_verify(x1, arg1, eval_point),
        self.semantics.extended_verify(x2, arg2, eval_point),
    )
)
```

### 2. Method-Based Semantic Relations

Following ModelChecker patterns, we use methods not Z3 primitives:

```python
def conflicts(self, bit_e1, bit_e2):
    """Check if two states conflict."""
    f1, f2 = z3.BitVecs("f1 f2", self.N)
    return Exists(
        [f1, f2],
        z3.And(
            self.is_part_of(f1, bit_e1),
            self.is_part_of(f2, bit_e2),
            self.excludes(f1, f2),
        ),
    )
```

### 3. Framework Integration

Proper inheritance and method signatures ensure compatibility:

```python
class WitnessSemantics(SemanticDefaults):
    def premise_behavior(self, world):
        """Define premise evaluation."""
        return world == self.main_world
        
    def conclusion_behavior(self, world):
        """Define conclusion evaluation."""
        return world == self.main_world
```

## Why Previous Attempts Failed

1. **Attempts 1-5**: Lost witness information after constraint generation
2. **Attempt 6**: IncCtx approach became too complex to manage
3. **Attempt 7**: Functions defined but not queryable during evaluation
4. **Attempt 8**: Lacked proper infrastructure for witness management

## Performance Characteristics

- **Constraint Complexity**: Slightly increased due to witness predicate constraints
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead from storing witness functions
- **Query Performance**: Direct function evaluation is fast
- **Overall Impact**: Negligible performance cost for correctness gain

## Future Extensions

1. **Optimization**: Cache witness queries for repeated evaluations
2. **Visualization**: Display witness mappings in model output
3. **Generalization**: Apply pattern to other semantic challenges
4. **Theory**: Explore implications of predicates as model citizens

## Conclusion

Attempt 9 demonstrates that seemingly intractable semantic implementation challenges can be solved through careful architectural choices. By making witness functions first-class model citizens, we achieved what eight previous attempts could not: a clean, correct, and maintainable implementation of uninegation semantics that fully integrates with the ModelChecker framework.

The key lesson: **Don't fight the framework - extend it thoughtfully.**
