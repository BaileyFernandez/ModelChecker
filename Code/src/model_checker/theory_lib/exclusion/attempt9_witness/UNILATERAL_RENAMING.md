# Unilateral Semantics Renaming Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the renaming from "exclusion theory" to "unilateral semantics" throughout the Attempt 9 implementation, along with proper attribution for the semantic approaches.

## Semantic Theory Attribution

### Unilateral Semantics
- **Authors**: Bernard and Champollion
- **Key Feature**: Propositions have only verifiers; negation emerges through an exclusion relation between states
- **Implementation**: This attempt9_witness directory

### Bilateral Semantics  
- **Authors**: Kit Fine and Benjamin Brast-McKie
- **Key Feature**: Propositions have both verifiers and falsifiers; negation is primitive
- **Implementation**: The logos theory in ModelChecker

## Terminology Changes

### Python Code Changes
1. **examples.py**:
   - "Witness predicate exclusion components" → "Witness predicate unilateral components"
   - "static exclusion" → "static unilateral semantics"
   - "Complex exclusion formula" → "Complex unilateral formula"
   - References to "t_exclusion.py" → "t_unilateral.py"

2. **semantic.py**:
   - "print("\nExclusion", file=output)" → "print("\nUnilateral Exclusion", file=output)"

### Documentation Changes

1. **README.md**:
   - Added comprehensive overview of unilateral vs bilateral semantics
   - Added attribution to Bernard & Champollion for unilateral approach
   - Added attribution to Fine & Brast-McKie for bilateral approach
   - "uninegation operator" → "unilateral negation operator"

2. **FINDINGS.md**:
   - Added attribution in executive summary
   - "exclusion semantics" → "unilateral semantics"
   - Noted contrast with bilateral approach

3. **TODO.md**:
   - "exclusion theory" → "unilateral theory"

4. **witness_implementation.md**:
   - "Exclusion operator" → "Unilateral negation operator"

5. **RENAMING_SUMMARY.md**:
   - Updated to reflect unilateral semantics terminology
   - Added contextual notes about Bernard and Champollion's approach

## Key Concepts Preserved

While updating terminology, we preserved:
- The term "exclusion" when referring to the specific relation between states
- Directory name "exclusion" for organizational continuity
- Import paths remain unchanged for compatibility

## Rationale

These changes:
1. Properly attribute the theoretical foundations to their respective authors
2. Clarify the distinction between unilateral and bilateral semantic approaches
3. Make the codebase more accessible to those familiar with the literature
4. Maintain consistency with academic terminology

## Implementation Note

The witness predicate implementation (Attempt 9) successfully implements Bernard and Champollion's unilateral semantics by making witness functions first-class model predicates, solving the False Premise Problem that affected previous attempts.
