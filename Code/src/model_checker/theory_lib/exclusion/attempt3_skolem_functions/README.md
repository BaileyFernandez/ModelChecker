# Attempt 3: Skolem Function Experiments

## Overview
**Date Range**: July 2024  
**Status**: Multiple Iterations - Issue Persists  
**Key Innovation**: Various approaches to Skolem function implementation

## Goals
- [x] Experiment with different Skolem function approaches
- [x] Create minimal SK implementation
- [x] Fix circular dependency issues
- [ ] Resolve false premise issue

## Approach
This attempt involved multiple iterations:
1. Initial SK implementation (sk_exclusion.py)
2. Corrected version fixing circular dependencies (sk_exclusion_correct.py)
3. Minimal semantic implementation (sk_semantic.py)
4. Minimal theory registration (sk_theory.py)

## Implementation Details
- **Strategy**: Multiple Skolem function experiments
- **Key Files**:
  - `semantic.py`: Minimal SK semantic (from sk_semantic.py)
  - `operators.py`: Corrected SK operators (from sk_exclusion_correct.py)
  - `examples.py`: Test examples
  - `sk_exclusion.py`: Initial attempt (preserved)
  - `sk_exclusion_correct.py`: Corrected version (preserved)
  - `sk_theory.py`: Minimal theory registration

## Results

### What Worked
- Successfully implemented multiple SK variations
- Fixed circular dependency issues
- Created minimal working implementations

### What Didn't Work
- False premises persisted across all SK variations
- No improvement over previous attempts

### Test Results
```
Results consistent with previous attempts
False premises in same 8 examples
```

## Running This Attempt
```bash
cd /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ModelChecker/Code
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/attempt3_skolem_functions/examples.py
```

## Key Learnings
1. Multiple SK implementations all show same issue
2. Circular dependencies were a red herring
3. The fundamental problem is deeper than implementation details

## Why This Led to the New Implementation Attempt
The consistent failure across multiple SK approaches suggested a need for a completely different strategy, leading to the comprehensive new implementation in attempt4.
