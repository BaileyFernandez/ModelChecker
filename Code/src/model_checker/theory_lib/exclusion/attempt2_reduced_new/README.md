# Attempt 2: Reduced Semantics on New Strategy

## Overview
**Date Range**: July 2024  
**Status**: Complete but Issue Persists  
**Key Innovation**: Clean primitive separation and recursive reduction

## Goals
- [x] Create streamlined implementation with clean primitives
- [x] Implement proper recursive reduction
- [x] Simplify multi-strategy complexity
- [ ] Fix false premise issue

## Approach
Following reduced_semantics.md, this attempt focused on:
- Only two Z3 primitives: `verify` and `excludes`
- All other relations derived (fusion = bitwise OR)
- Complete recursive reduction to primitives
- Single Skolemized strategy implementation

## Implementation Details
- **Strategy**: Reduced/simplified semantics
- **Key Files**:
  - `semantic.py`: Clean primitive separation (from reduced_semantic.py)
  - `operators.py`: Simplified operators (from reduced_operators.py)
  - `examples.py`: Test examples

## Results

### What Worked
- 4.3x performance improvement (0.091s vs 0.393s)
- Much cleaner code structure
- Proper recursive reduction achieved
- No implementation errors

### What Didn't Work
- All 8 problematic examples still showed false premises
- 3 additional examples showed true conclusions

### Test Results
```
Total Examples: 34
Valid results: 23 (67.6%)
Invalid models: 11
  - False premises: 8
  - True conclusions: 3
Average Time: 0.091s
```

## Documentation
- [`docs/reduced_semantics.md`](docs/reduced_semantics.md): Detailed implementation plan

## Running This Attempt
```bash
cd /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ModelChecker/Code
./dev_cli.py -p -z src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/attempt2_reduced_new/examples.py
```

## Key Learnings
1. Performance can be significantly improved with clean design
2. The false premise issue is NOT an implementation problem
3. The persistence across different implementations suggests a deeper issue

## Why This Attempt Led to New Understanding
The clean implementation and excellent performance, combined with persistent false premises, strongly suggested that the issue was in the semantic theory itself rather than the implementation.
