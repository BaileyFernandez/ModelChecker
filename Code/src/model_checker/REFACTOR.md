# ModelChecker Refactoring Implementation Plan (Logos/Exclusion Focus)

**Created**: 2025-07-21  
**Purpose**: Focused implementation plan for logos and exclusion theories  
**Timeline**: 5-7 weeks (3-4 weeks with parallel execution)

## Overview

This document provides a focused implementation plan for refactoring the ModelChecker repository with exclusive attention to the **logos** and **exclusion** theories. All tasks related to default, bimodal, and imposition theories have been moved to REMAINING.md for future work.

## Strategic Focus

**DEVELOPMENT PRIORITY**: This refactoring plan focuses exclusively on the **logos** and **exclusion** theories. This focused approach allows for:
- Deeper improvements to the most complex and important theories
- Creating exemplary implementations that can serve as models
- Faster delivery of improvements
- More concentrated testing and documentation efforts

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Fix Exception Handling Violations

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Effort**: 1 day  
**Owner**: Core team

#### Tasks:
1. **Check logos and exclusion for bare except blocks**
   - Search `src/model_checker/theory_lib/logos/` for any bare except
   - Search `src/model_checker/theory_lib/exclusion/` for any bare except
   - If found, replace with specific exception handling

2. **Implementation pattern**:
   ```python
   # Replace any bare except with specific exceptions
   try:
       # code that might fail
   except (AttributeError, ValueError, TypeError) as e:
       # Let specific errors propagate as per fail-fast philosophy
       raise ValueError(f"Specific error context: {e}")
   ```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks:
1. **Complexity in logos subtheories**: May require extra time
2. **Exclusion experimental features**: May need stabilization
3. **Jupyter integration challenges**: May need architecture changes

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Start with simpler tasks to build momentum
- Create feature branches for experimental work
- Regular check-ins on progress
- Be prepared to adjust timeline for complex issues

## Conclusion

This focused implementation plan concentrates all efforts on making logos and exclusion theories exemplary implementations. By the end of this 5-7 week effort, these two theories will serve as gold standards for:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Perfect documentation
- Clean, maintainable code
- Excellent Jupyter integration
- Performance optimization

The patterns, utilities, and standards developed during this focused work will make it much easier to bring the remaining theories (default, bimodal, imposition) up to the same standard in a future phase.
