# Application

## Project Overview

`Provide an explanation/background of your UROP project that includes with whom you are conducting research.`

With intensional models of semantics, linguists and philosophers have been able to model many aspects of human reasoning.
However, counterfactual conditional statements—those of the form, for example, “if Nixon were to press the button, there would be a nuclear holocaust”—have proved difficult to adequately model under intensional semantic models.
This is largely because many inference rules that are valid for basic (“indicative” in linguistics) counterfactuals do not hold for counterfactual conditionals, like Strengthening the Antecedent, of the form A ⊃ C ⊢ (A ∧ B) ⊃ C. 
To this point, Dr. Brast-McKie, a post-doc in the Linguistics and Philosophy department, has developed a hyperintensional semantic model for counterfactual statements.
There are many inference rules, which can be thought of as hypothesized valid lines of reasoning, that a model of counterfactuals should not count as valid.
As a result, ensuring that a proposed semantic model for counterfactuals contains countermodels to these invalid inference rules.
Finding these countermodels is quite time-consuming to do by hand, so I will be working with Dr. Brast-McKie to computationally find countermodels for these invalid inference rules. 
A sound semantics for counterfactuals is important because having a formal model of how counterfactuals work would be a good step towards models of causal thinking.
Understanding these mechanisms may help in AI research—if we can model counterfactual reasoning, we may be able to understand more of how neural networks work, if they in fact demonstrate this type of reasoning. 




## Personal Responsibilities & Goals

`Describe your planned role in the project. Be as specific as you can about your personal research duties/responsibilities, expected deliverables, and research goals you hope to accomplish by the end of term.`

My responsibility in the UROP would be to make a program that finds countermodels for rules that should be invalid in a semantics for counterfactual conditionals. 

Expected deliverables are the program, and results on the countermodels. 

Ideally, the program would be understandable and usable by people without ample programming experience—finding countermodels in semantics to invalid rules is important, but often impeded by the computational effort it takes to do this by hand, as it is done usually given most semanticists do not have ample programming experience.
As such, making this accessible to non-programmers would allow for similar tools to be used in the field, thus making computationally expensive models (at least relative to human calculation) more tractable. 




## Personal Statement

`Briefly state why you are interested in this UROP and explain what you hope to gain from it.`

To me, one of the most satisfying parts of linguistics/philosophy is being able to formalize and model things that seem subjective or intangible (for linguistics, that is human language).
This project aims to do exactly that for counterfactuall statements.
Additionally, A sound semantics for counterfactuals would have applications in AI research and linguistics, two fields I am interested in.
So, I hope to learn more about advanced models in semantics through this UROP. 
In terms of hard skills, I hope to improve my programming skills, especially in making code that is easily understandable by others, especially those with limited programming experience.
My programming experience so far, while robust, has been limited to programs I write for myself (like in 6.100 or 6.101) or for others with programming experience (like in other classes or internships).
So making code transparent to those without experience would be a nice challenge.
