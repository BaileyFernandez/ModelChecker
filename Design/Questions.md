# Questions

Questions should be organized under a topic when possible.

## General

- What other tools are needed in addition to Z3, Python, and Git

## Z3

General

- Suppose Z3 finds that ${ A, B, C, ~D }$ is unsatisfiable.
  - How do we know how many models it tried and how big those models were?
  - Knowing this tells us about the strength of the evidence that ${ A, B, C }$ entails $D$.

Interpretation

- what are the primitive types/sorts in Z3?
- can types/sorts be defined and what does this mean/entail?

Optimization

- What size bitvector does it make sense to start with?
