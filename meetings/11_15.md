# NOTE

- where does emergent exclude get used for Champillion?
- in update methods for Sentence (maybe `prefix_type` to `prefix_obj`) unpack defined operators
  - upshot: maybe don't need find `verifiers_and_falsifier` or `true_at` in DerivedOperator so as to be purely syntactic
  - where does `self.sentence` get used in `PropositionDefaults`
- remove `\top` clause in `extended_verify` and `extended_falsify` from `Semantics`
- change all prefix definitions to be lists to match in `DefinedOperators`
  - may not be needed once update method is fixed as above
- print functions
  - push colors, etc., from `print_propositions` to `hidden_helpers`
  - print methods for operators are often redundant: move to helpers
- how to define `preclude` without introducing lots of primitives?
- look into new version of Fine's imposition
