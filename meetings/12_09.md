# NOTES

- the Semantics class has N as an argument and Proposition as a subclass
- each Operator class is independent of the Semantics and includes:
  - syntactic attributes
  - semantic methods
  - printing methods
- the ModelSetup class stores:
  - all user inputs and flags
  - all Z3 constraints by calling the Semantics and Operator class instances
  - the Semantics and relevant Operator class instances used to generate the Z3 constraints
- the ModelSetup instance is then passed to ModelStructure which stores:
  - the Z3 model
  - attributes for time, etc.
  - a proposition for each subsentence by calling on the Proposition instance
  - general printing methods
  - saving methods
