# NOTES

- The new modules look great! 
- true and false behavior cut to the chase?
- where should proposition class go?
  - should it include the model constraints?
  - should it include the print methods?
- solve in ModelSetup and return ModelStructure
- separate syntax from semantics
  - make it operator agnostic
  - should know which expressions are well-formed without semantics
- make null constraints default which can be turned off if contingent is on or if specified
